<p><span class="smcap">Louis Raemaekers</span> will stand out for all time as one of the supreme figures which the
Great War has called into being. His genius has been enlisted in the service of mankind,
and his work, being entirely sincere and untouched by racial or national prejudice,
will endure; indeed, it promises to gain strength as the years advance. When the
intense passions, which have been awakened by this world struggle, have faded away,
civilisation will regard the war largely through these wonderful drawings. By them,
not only the methods of German warfare will be judged, but the resolution will surely
be begotten and nurtured that never again, so far as it is humanly possible, shall a
recurrence of Teuton inhumanity and barbarism be permitted.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Before the war had been in progress many weeks the cartoons in the Amsterdam
<i>Telegraaf</i> attracted attention in the capitals of Europe, many leading newspapers
reproducing them. The German authorities, quick to realise their full significance, did
all in their power to suppress them. Through German intrigue Raemaekers has been
charged in the Dutch Courts with endangering the neutrality of Holland—and
acquitted. A price has been set on his head, should he ever venture over the border.</p>

<p>When only a week or two ago he crossed to England, his wife received anonymous
post-cards, warning her that his ship would certainly be torpedoed in the North Sea.
The <i>Cologne Gazette</i>, in a leading article on Holland, threatens that country that
“after the War Germany will settle accounts with Holland, and for each calumny,
for each cartoon of Raemaekers, she will demand payment with the interest that is due
to her.” Not since Saul and the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting with
the Philistines has so unexpected a champion arisen. With brush and pencil this
Dutch painter will do even as David did with the smooth stone out of the brook;
he will destroy the braggart Goliath, who, strong in his own might, defies the forces of
the living God.</p>

<p>When Mr. Raemaekers came to London in December, he was received by the
Prime Minister, and was entertained at a complimentary luncheon by the Journalists
of the British capital. Similar honour was conferred on him on his second visit.
He was the guest of honour at the Savage Club; the Royal Society of Miniature
Painters elected him an Honorary Member. But it has been left to France to pay the
most fitting recognition to his genius and to his services in the cause of freedom and
truth. The Cross of the Legion of Honour has been presented to him, and on his visit
to Paris this month a special reception is to be held in his honour at La Sorbonne,
which is the highest purely intellectual reward Europe can confer on any man.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The great Dutch cartoonist is now in his forty-seventh year. He was born in
Holland, his father, who is dead, having been the editor of a provincial newspaper.
His mother, who is still alive and exceedingly proud of her son’s fame, is a German
by birth, but rejoices that she married a Dutchman and thus escaped from the
debasing influences of her native land. Mr. Raemaekers, who is short, fair, and of
a ruddy countenance, looks at least ten years younger than his age. He took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
painting and drawing when quite young and learnt his art in Holland and in Brussels.
All his life he has lived in his own country, but with frequent visits to Belgium and
Germany, where, through his mother, he has many relations. Thus he knows by
experience the nature of the peoples whom he depicts.</p>

<p>For many years he was a landscape painter and a portrait painter, and made money
and local reputation. Six or seven years ago he turned his attention to political work,
and became a cartoonist and caricaturist on the staff of the Amsterdam <i>Telegraaf</i>,
thus opening the way to a fame which is not only world-wide but which will endure
as long as the memory of the Great War lasts. His ideas come to him naturally
and without effort. Suggestions do not assist him; they hinder him when he endeavours
to act on them. He is an artist to his finger-tips and throws the whole force of
his being into his work. Some years ago he married a Dutch lady, who is devoted
to music, and they have three children, two girls and a boy (the youngest); the
eldest is now twelve. Very happy in his home, Mr. Raemaekers has no ambitions
outside it, except to go on with his work and to continue the fight against the
German Evil. A Teuton paper has declared that Raemaekers’ cartoons are worth
at least two Army Corps to the Allies. This saying has pleased him greatly; he only
wishes they were worth four Army Corps.</p>

<p>The strong religious tendency which so often distinguishes his work makes one
instinctively ask to what Church does the artist belong. He replies that he belongs to
none, but was brought up a Catholic, and his wife a Protestant, and the differences
which in later life severed each from their early teaching caused them to meet on
common ground. But the intense Christian feeling of these drawings is beyond cavil
or dispute: they again and again bring home to the heart the vital truths of the
Faith with irresistible force, and the artist ever expresses the Christianity, not perhaps
of the theologian, but of the honest and kindly man of the world.</p>

<p>Praise has been bestowed upon his work by several German papers—qualified
praise. The <i>Leipziger Volkszeitung</i> has declared that Raemaekers’ cartoons show
unimpeachable art and great power of execution, but that they all lack one thing.
They have no wit, no spirit. Which is true—in a sense. They do lack wit—German
wit; they do lack spirit—German spirit. And what German wit and German spirit
may be one can comprehend by a study of Raemaekers’ cartoons.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The cartoons by Louis Raemaekers properly need no introduction, since they
explain themselves in every line. But it might be usefully pointed out that, so
far, our Fleet has saved us from actual sight of Germany’s war methods. What
shells and bombs we know have arrived from the blue, lacking the personality of
the despatchers. Raemaekers lives on the other side of an electrified wire within
a very short distance of the slaughter-houses at work. He has dealt with people
still bloody, sweating, and dusty from their flight. He knows, or he knows friends
who know men and women dead or dishonoured, or in present peril of murder or
rape. He understands, as well as all his countrymen, that Belgium is being
vivisected on Holland’s doorstep, that Holland may take warning. He is more
than any resident in Great Britain <em>of</em> that tragedy. His evidence then is as
unimpeachable as his art.</p>

<p>Raemaekers also realises in his presentments what we do not—that the German
foulness in war is an integral part of the German philosophy of life, and when the
armies give themselves up to their reasoned abominations, it is no more than
Germany going joyously to the realisation of the depraved dreams which have
been instilled into its mind in peace. He does not lose his temper over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
fact. His line cuts as deeply as possible because he knows not only the visible
act, but the life-tendency which made the act inevitable. We do not. We
still keep the idea that certain things “are not done.” Our geographical position
prevents us feeling the pressure that keeps the neutral nations quiet and useful
to Germany. Our caricaturists only see the outside of things. So it happens
that we who would be most affected by defeat are the least affected now in our
own minds.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The abomination of frightfulness in Belgium recalls the sufferings and degradations
which English women and children endured nearly sixty years ago when a section of
the Indian army rebelled, and the mutineers, being joined by certain disaffected Indian
princes and landowners, overcame small and isolated British communities and perpetrated
identically the same barbarities as have been deliberately practised by the
German troops during the present war. It was then that Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes,
the distinguished American essayist, gave utterance to the following opinion in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>; it is now embodied in his well-known work “The Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table.” Although the official voice of the United States has uttered no such protest,
there is reason to believe that these words written by an American pen nine-and-fifty
years ago do still represent the reasoned opinion of the bulk of American men and
women:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who was that person that was so abused some time since for saying that in the
conflict of two races our sympathies naturally go with the higher? No matter who
he was. Now look at what is going on in India—a white, superior “Caucasian”
race, against a dark-skinned, inferior, but still “Caucasian” race—and where are
English and American sympathies? We can’t stop to settle all the doubtful
questions; all we know is, that the brute nature is sure to come out most strongly
in the lower race, and it is the general law that the human side of humanity should
treat the brutal side as it does the same nature in the inferior animals—tame it, or
crush it. The Indian mail brings stories of women and children outraged and
murdered; the royal stronghold is in the hands of the babe-killers. England takes
down the Map of the World, which she has girdled with empire, and makes a
correction thus: Delhi, <em>Dele!</em> The civilised world says, Amen.</p>
</div>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><em>Dele!</em> Destroy utterly! Wipe off the face of the world—not Germany, or the
German capital, or the German people, but the German philosophy of life as it has
been expounded by its chief evangels, Treitschke, Bernhardi, and others. <em>Dele!</em>
That should be the motto of each one of us. It is the message which Louis
Raemaekers speaks with the whole strength of his genius. It has to be accomplished
by the individual in his own sphere; it is a duty which cannot be deputised. Germany
has proclaimed: “War is war; no treaty too sacred, no human right too divine, no
woman too weak, no babe too tender to escape from the blind, brutal violence of war.”
We must fight to the death. Either German philosophy is to be established, and
freedom of body, mind, and soul crushed beneath the iron heel of Prussian Kultur, or
else, at whatever the cost, this fearful menace to the peace and liberty of nations and
individuals has to be destroyed root and branch. “I came not to send peace but
a sword,” said the Saviour. Are we, who boast ourselves Christians and have heretofore
rejoiced in Christianity, too weak or too fearful in this day of battle to take up the
Saviour’s sword and to war for the eternal principles and ideals of right, justice, mercy,
and loving-kindness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>This struggle is not merely a matter for the fighting men. It has to be carried
into our counting-houses, our shops, our schools, and, if need be, our homes. Wherever
we encounter the insidious presence of Germany and German ideas, there must they
be overthrown, no matter how costly, difficult, or disagreeable the work may prove
personally. The German has been taught that duty to his own State outweighs the
laws of God and man. To betray hospitality, to be false to both written and spoken
word, to be full of deceit, lying, and treachery—these are esteemed honourable actions
even in times of peace where German interests are concerned by all her people from
the Kaiser downwards. And the reverse is equally true. They who are not Germans,
and who refuse to subscribe to the canons of Kultur, are reckoned beyond the pale of
civilisation.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Nothing has been stated here which cannot be proved by independent testimony.
The literature of the war and of the events antecedent to the war has grown apace, and
this short prefatory note is not the place to review it. But attention may be profitably
drawn to the testimony, borne by another neutral, to German methods. Dr. Anton
Nyström, one of the most distinguished sons of Sweden, a historian of high repute, who
has travelled widely throughout Europe, in his book “Before, During, and After 1914,”
written only last summer, establishes that public feeling has been deliberately created
in Germany during the last fifty years that that country should assume the mastery of
all nations related to Germany without regard to material and historical factors. And
wherever this mastery has been assumed, whether in Schleswig-Holstein, Poland, or
Alsace and Lorraine, a systematic and ruthless suppression of the mother-tongue has
been attempted, and the peoples have been persecuted for any tokens of affection for
their own nationality. As it has been, so it will be again, if Germany triumphs.
Furthermore, we know well to-day that the mastery of the Germanic peoples was
intended only to be the beginning of the mastery of the world.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>When complete these portfolios of Louis Raemaekers’ cartoons will constitute
the most marvellous record of the horrible realities of this vast world-struggle, and
will have a historical value which will grow greater with time. Already the
originals have been purchased, and their present owners, in most instances,
would not part with them for ten times the price they have paid. It has been
well said that no man living amidst these surging seas of blood and tears has
come nearer to the rôle of Peacemaker than Raemaekers. The peace which he
works for is not a matter of arrangement between diplomatists and politicians:
it is the peace which the intelligence and the soul of the Western world shall
insist on in the years to be. God grant it be not long delayed, but it can only
come when the enemy is entirely overthrown and the victory is overwhelming
and complete.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">These</span> pictures, with their haunting sense of
beauty and their biting satire, might almost
have been drawn by the finger of the Accusing
Angel. As the spectator gazes on them the full
weight of the horrible cruelty and senseless futility
of war overwhelms the soul, and, sinking helplessly
beneath it, he feels inclined to assume the same
attitude of despair as is shown in “Christendom
after Twenty Centuries.”</p>
</div>

<p>“War is war,” the Germans preached and
practised, and no matter how clement and correct
may be the humanity of the Allies, we realise through
these pictures what the human race has to face and
endure once peace be broken. Is “Christendom after
Twenty Centuries” to be even as Christianity was in
the first century—an excuse for the perpetration of
mad cruelties by degenerate Cæsars or Kaisers (spell
it as you will) at their games? Cannot the higher
and finer attributes of mankind be developed and
strengthened without this apparently needless waste
of agony and life? Is human nature only to be
redeemed through the Cross, and must Calvary bear
again and again its heavy load of human anguish?</p>

<p>One cannot escape from this inner questioning
as one gazes on Raemaekers’ cartoons.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Were</span> I privileged to have a hand at the Peace Conference,
my co-operation would take the part of deeds and I should
only ask to hang the walls of the council chamber with
life-size reproductions of Raemaekers in blood-red frames. For
human memory is weak, and as mind of man cannot grasp the
meaning of a million, so may it well fail to keep steadily before itself
the measure of Belgium—the rape and murder, the pillage and
plunder, the pretences under which perished women and priests and
children, the brutal tyranny—the left hand that beckoned in friendly
fashion, the right hand, hidden with the steel.</p>
</div>

<p>We can very safely leave France to remember Northern France
and Russia not to forget Poland; but let Belgium and Serbia be at
the front of the British mind and conscience; let her lift her eyes
to these scorching pictures when Germany fights with all her cunning
for a peace that shall leave Prussia scotched, not killed.</p>

<p>Already one reads despondent articles, that the English tradition,
to forgive and forget, is going to wreck the peace; and students of
psychology fear that within us lie ineradicable qualities that will save
the situation for Germany at the end.</p>

<p>To suspect such a national weakness is surely to arm against it
and see that our contribution to the Peace Conference shall not
stultify our contribution to the War.</p>

<p>The Germans have been kite-flying for six months, to see which
way the wind blows; and when the steady hurricane broke the strings
and flung the kites headlong to earth, those who sent them up were
sufficiently proclaimed by their haste to disclaim.</p>

<p>But when the actual conditions are created and the new “Scrap
of Paper” comes to light, since German honour is dead and her
oath in her own sight worthless, let it be worthless in our sight also,
and let the terms of peace preclude her power to perjure herself
again. Make her honest by depriving her of the strength to be
dishonest. There is only one thing on earth the German will ever
respect, and that is superior force. May Berlin, therefore, see an
army of occupation; and may “peace” be a word banished from
every Allied tongue until that preliminary condition of peace is
accomplished, and Germany sees other armies than her own.</p>

<p>Reason has been denied speech in this war; but if she is
similarly banished from the company of the peace-makers, then woe
betide the constitution of the thing they will create, for a “stable
peace” must be the very last desire of those now doomed to defeat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Some</span> “neutrals,” and even some of the people
here in England, still doubt the reality of the
German atrocities in Belgium, but Raemaekers
has seen and spoken with those to whom the scene
depicted in this cartoon is an ugly reality. One who
would understand it to the full must visualise the
hands behind the thrusting rifle butts, and the faces
behind the hands, as well as the praying, maddened,
despairing, vengeful women of the picture—and must
visualise, too, the men thrust back another way, to
wait <em>their</em> fate at the hands of these apostles of a
civilisation of force.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet even then full realisation is impossible; the man
whose pencil has limned these faces has only caught
a far-off echo of the reality, and thus we who see his
picture are yet another stage removed from the full
horror of the scene that he gives us. Not on us, in
England, have the rifle butts fallen; not for us has
it chanced that we should be shepherded “men to the
right, women to the left”; not ours the trenched
graves and the extremity of shame. Thus it is not
for us to speak, as the people of Belgium and Northern
France will speak, of the limits of endurance, and of
war’s last terrors imposed on those whom war should
have passed by and left untouched. We gather,
dimly and with but a tithe of the feeling that experience
can impart, that these extremities of shame and
suffering have been imposed on a people that has done
no wrong, and we may gain some slight satisfaction
from the thought that to this nation is apportioned a
share in the work of vengeance on the criminals.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is the most bestial part of this most bestial thing that it
is calculated and a matter of orders. The private soldier
takes his share of the loot, and is generally the instrument
of the cold and ordered killing; but it is the officer-class which most
profits in goods, and it is the higher command which dictates the
policy. It was so in 1870. It is much more so to-day.</p>
</div>

<p>This note of calculation is particularly to be seen in the
fluctuations through which that policy has passed. When the
enemy was absolutely certain of victory, out-numbering the invader
by nearly two to one and sweeping all before him, we had
massacres upon massacres: Louvain, Aerschot, the wholesale
butchery of Dinant, the Lorraine villages (and in particular the
hell of Guébervilliers). Even at the very extremity of his tide of
invasion, and in the last days of it, came the atrocities and
destruction of Sermaize. In the very act of the defeat which
has pinned him and began the process of his destruction he was
attempting yet a further repetition of these unnameable things
at Senlis under the very gates of Paris.</p>

<p>Then came the months when he felt less secure. The whole
thing was at once toned down by order. Pillage was reduced to
isolated cases, and murder also. Few children suffered.</p>

<p>A recovery of confidence throughout his Eastern successes last
summer renewed the crimes. Poland is full of them, and the
Serbian land as well.</p>

<p>In general, you have throughout these months of his ordeal a
regular succession, of excess in vileness when he is confident, of
restraint in it when he is touched by fear.</p>

<p>This effect of fear upon the dull soul is a characteristic familiar
to all men who know their Prussian from history, particularly the
wealthier governing classes of Prussia. It is a characteristic which
those who are in authority during this war will do well to bear in
mind. Properly used, that knowledge may be made an instrument
of victory.</p>

of the wonderful power which he exercises over the
mind of the people. Each of us knows what is in
that goods-van and we shudder at its hideous hidden

</div>

<p>Of all the historical ignorance upon which the
foolish Pacifist’s case is founded, perhaps the worst
is the conception that these abominations are the
natural accompaniment of war. They <em>have</em> attached
to war when war was ill organised in type. But the
more subject to rule it has become, the more men have
gloried in arms, the more they have believed the high
trade of soldier to be a pride, the more have they
eliminated the pillage of the civilian and the slaughter
of the innocent from its actions. Those things belong
to violent passion and to lack of reason. Modern
war and the chivalric tradition scorned them.</p>

<p>The edges of the Germanies have, in the past,
been touched by the chivalric tradition: Prussia
never. That noblest inheritance of Christendom
never reached out so far into the wilds. And to
Germany, now wholly Prussianised—which will kill
us or which we shall kill—soldier is no high thing,
nor is there any meaning attached to the word
“Glorious.” War is for that State a business: a
business only to be undertaken with profit against
what is certainly weaker; to be undertaken without
faith and with a cruelty in proportion to that weakness.
In particular it must be a terror to women, to
children, and to the aged—for these remain unarmed.</p>

<p>This country alone of the original alliance has been
spared pillage. It has not been spared murder. But
this country, though the process has perhaps been
more gradual than elsewhere, is very vividly alive
to-day to what would necessarily follow the presence
of German soldiery upon English land.</p>

in a life-and-death struggle would only play the war game
in accordance with the rules drawn up by civilised peoples,
he would, indeed, command our admiration no less than our
respect. Never on this earth was there such a splendid fighting
machine as that “made in Germany.” The armies against us are
the last word in discipline, fitness, and equipment; and are led
by men who, born in barracks, weaned on munitions, have but
one aim and end in view—“World-Dominion or Downfall.”</p>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, instead of winning our admiration
they have drawn our detestation. Not content with brushing aside
all international laws of warfare, they have trampled upon every
law, human and divine, standing in their way of conquest. Indeed,
Germany’s method of fighting would disgrace the savages of
Central Africa.</p>

<p>Prussianised Germany has the monopoly of “frightfulness.”
When not “frightful,” Prussians troopers are not living down
to the instructions of their War-lords to leave the conquered
with nothing but eyes to weep with. Not content to crucify
Canadians, murder priests, violate nuns, mishandle women, and
bayonet children, the enemy torpedoes civilian-carrying liners,
and bombs Red Cross hospitals. More, sinning against
posterity as well as antiquity, Germans stand charged before
man and God with reducing to ashes some of the finest artistic
output of Christian civilisation. When accused of crimes such
as these, Germany answers through her generals: “The
commonest, ugliest stone put to mark the burial-place of a
German grenadier is a more glorious and venerable monument
than all the cathedrals of Europe put together” (General von
Disfurth in <i lang="de">Hamburger Nachrichten</i>). “Thus is fulfilled the well-known
prophecy of Heine: ‘When once that restraining talisman,
the Cross, is broken ... Thor, with his colossal hammer, will leap
up, and with it shatter into fragments the Gothic cathedrals’”
(<i>Religion and Philosophy in Germany in the Nineteenth Century</i>).</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cartoon bears the quotation from Bernhardi
“War is as divine as eating and
drinking.” Yes; and German war is as
divine as German eating and drinking. Anyone who
has been in a German restaurant during that mammoth
midday meal which generally precedes a sleep
akin to a hibernation, will understand how the same
strange barbarous solemnity has ruined all the real
romance of war. There is no way of conveying the
distinction, except by saying vaguely that there is a
way of doing things, and that butchering is not
necessary to a good army any more than gobbling is
necessary to a good dinner. In our own insular
shorthand it can be, insufficiently and narrowly but
not unprofitably, expressed by saying that it is
possible both to fight and to eat like a gentleman.
It is therefore highly significant that Mr. Raemaekers
has in this cartoon conceived the devil primarily
as a kind of ogre. It is a matter of great interest
that this Dutch man of genius, like that other genius
whose pencil war has turned into a sword, Will Dyson,
tends in the presence of Prussia (which has been for
many moderns their first glimpse of absolute or
positive evil) to depriving the devil of all that moonshine
of dignity which sentimental sceptics have
given him. Evil does not mean dignity, any more
than it means any other good thing. The stronger
caricaturists have, in a sense, fallen back on the
medieval devil; not because he is more mystical,
but because he is more material. The face of
Raemaekers’ Satan, with its lifted jowl and bared
teeth, has less of the half-truth of cynicism than of
mere ignominious greed. The armies are spread out
for him as a banquet; and the war which he praises,
and which was really spread for him in Flanders, is
not a Crusade but a cannibal feast.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Germans have committed many more
indefensible crimes than the military execution
of the kind-hearted nurse who had
helped war-prisoners to escape. They have murdered
hundreds of women who had committed no offence
whatever against their military rules. But though
not the worst of their misdeeds, this has probably
been the stupidest. It gained us almost as many
recruits as the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, and it made
the whole world understand—what is unhappily the
truth—that the German is wholly destitute of chivalry.
He knows indeed that people of other nations are
affected by this sentiment; but he despises them for
it. Woman is the weaker vessel; and therefore,
according to his code, she must be taught to know
her place, which is to cook and sew, and produce
“cannon-fodder” for the Government. Readers of
Schopenhauer and Nietzsche will remember the advice
given by those philosophers for the treatment of
women. Nietzsche recommends a whip. It never
occurred to German officialdom that the pedantic
condemnation of one obscure woman, guilty by the
letter of their law, would stir the heart of England
and America to the depths, and steel our soldiers to
further efforts against an enemy whose moral unlikeness
to ourselves becomes more apparent with
every new phase in the struggle.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">What</span> does this cartoon suggest? I am asked and I ask
myself. At first very little, almost nothing, only uninteresting,
ugly death, gloomy, ghastly, dismal, but dull
and largely featureless, blank and negative. Has the artist’s
power failed him? No, it is strongly drawn. Has his inspiration?
What does it mean? Is it indeed meant? As I gaze and pore
on it longer, I seem to see that it is just in this blank negation
that its strength and its suggestion lie. It is meant. It has
meaning. A blast has passed over this place, and this is its sequel;
its derelict rubbish.</p>
</div>

<p>It is death unredeemed, death with no very positive suggestion,
with no hint of heroism, none of heroic action, little even of heroic
passion; just death, helpless, hopeless, pointing to nothing but
decomposition, decay, disappearance, <i lang="fr">anéantissement</i>, reduction
of the fair frame of life to nothingness. That is the peculiar horror
of this war. Were the picture, as it well might be, even more
hideous, and did it suggest something more definite, a story of
struggle, say, recorded in contortion, or by wounds and weapons,
it might be better.</p>

<p>But men killed by machines, men killed by natural forces
unnaturally employed, are indeed a fact and a spectacle squalid,
sorry, unutterably sad.</p>

<p>All wars have been horrible, but modern wars are more in
extremes. Heroism is there, but not always. It is possible only
in patches. There is much of the mere sacrifice of numbers.
Strictly, there are scenes far worse than this, for death unredeemed
is not the worst of sufferings or of ills. But few are sadder. This
is indeed war made by those who hold it and will it to be “not a
sport, but a science.” There is no sport here. Men killed like
this are like men killed by plague or the eruption of a volcano.
And, indeed, what else are they? They are victims of a diseased
humanity of the eruption—literal and metaphorical—of its hidden
fires. And wars will grow more and more like this. What can
stop them and banish these scenes? Only the hate of hate, only the
love that can redeem even such a sight as this when at last we remember
that it is for love’s sake only that flesh and blood are in the
last resort content to endure it.</p>

“kultur,” which is in reality but another
word for “system” or “organisation,”
rather than that which English-speaking people understand
by “culture,” has built up a system of internal
credit that shall ensure the correct balance of the
bubble—for just as long as the militarist policy of
Germany can endure the strain of war. But money
alone is not sufficient for victory; the peasant hard
put to it to suppress his laugh, and the crowned
Germania that built up the paper pedestal of the
bubble, needed many other things to make that
pedestal secure; there was needed integrity, and the
respect of neighbouring nations, and the understanding
of other points of view beside the doctrine of
force, and liberty instead of coercion of a whole
nation, and many other things that the older civilisations
of Europe have accepted as parts of their code
of life—the things this new, upstart Germany has not
had time to learn. Thus, with the paper credit—and
even with the gold reserve of which Germany has
boasted, the pedestal is but paper. And the winds
that blow from the flooded, corpse-strewn districts of
the Yser, from Artois, from Champagne and the
Vosges hills and forests, and from the long, long line
of Russia’s grim defences—these winds shall blow it

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> are some English critics who have not
yet considered so simple a thing as that
the case against horrors must be horrible.
In this respect alone this publication of the work of
the distinguished foreign cartoonist is a thing for our
attention and enlightenment. It is the whole point
of the awful experience which has to-day swallowed up
all our smaller experiences, that we are in any case
confronted with the abominable; and the most
beautiful thing we can hope to show is only an
abomination of it. Nevertheless, there is horror and
horror. The distinction between brute exaggeration
and artistic emphasis could hardly be better studied
than in Mr. Raemaekers’ cartoon, and the use he makes
of the very ancient symbol of the wheel. Europe
is represented as dragged and broken upon the wheel
as in the old torture; but the wheel is that of a modern
cannon, so that the dim background can be filled in
with the suggestion of a wholly modern machinery.
This is a very true satire; for there are many scientific
persons who seem to be quite reconciled to the crushing
of humanity by a vague mechanical environment in
which there are wheels within wheels. But the inner
restraint of the artist is suggested in the treatment
of the torment itself; which is suggested by a certain
rending drag in the garments, while the limbs are
limp and the head almost somnolent. She does not
strive nor cry; neither is her voice heard in the
streets. The artist had not to draw pain but to draw
despair; and while the pain is old enough the particular
despair is modern. The victim racked for a
creed could at least cry “I am converted.” But
here even the terms of surrender are unknowable;
and she can only ask “Am I civilised?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Uncle Sam</span> is no longer the simple New England farmer of a
century ago. He is rich beyond calculation. His family is
more numerous than that of any European country save
Russia. His interests are world-wide, his trade tremendous, his
industry complex, his finance fabulous. Above all, his family is no
longer of one race. The hatreds of Europe are not echoed in his
house; they are shared and reverberate through his corridors. It is
difficult, then, for him to take the simple views of right and wrong,
of justice and humanity, that he took a century ago. He is tempted
to balance a hundred sophistries against the principles of freedom and
good faith that yet burn strongly within him. He is driven to
temporise with the evil thing he hates, because he fears, if he does not,
that his household will be split, and thus the greater evil befall him.
But those that personify the evil may goad him once too often.
Dumba the lesser criminal—as also the less dexterous—has betrayed
himself and is expelled. When will Bernstorff’s turn come? That
it will come, indeed <em>must</em> come, is self-evident. The artist sees
things too clearly as they are not to see also what they will be.
He therefore skips the ignoble interlude of prevarication, quibble, and
intrigue, and gives us Uncle Sam happy at last in his recovered
simplicity. So we see him here, enjoying himself, as only a white
man can, in a whole-hearted spurning of lies, cruelty, and murder.</p>

<p>Note that Bernstorff—the victim of a gesture “fortunately rare
amongst gentlemen”—is already in full flight through the air, while
Uncle Sam’s left foot has still fifteen inches to travel. The promise
of an added velocity indicates that the flight of the unmasked
diplomatist will be far. The sketched vista of descending steps gives
us the satisfaction of knowing that the drop at the end will be deep.
Every muscle of our sinewy relative is tense, limp, and projectile—the
mouthpiece of Prussia goes to his inevitable end. There is no
need of a sequel to show him shattered and crumpled at the bottom
of the stairway.</p>

possible. The comparatively simple methods of killing employed by
barbarians could not have destroyed so many lives; nor could
barbarian states have raised such huge armies. The artist makes us
feel that such a war as this is an act of moral madness, a disgrace to
our common humanity. It is true that some of the nations engaged are
guiltless, and others almost guiltless; but there is a solidarity of
European civilisation which obliges us all to share the shame and
sorrow of this monstrous crime. Universal war is the <i lang="la">reductio ad

bad temper or bullying or terrorism it may please her to exercise.
And none perhaps is worse off in this respect than Holland. It suits
Germany to be fairly civil to Switzerland, who could give her a good
deal of trouble by joining France and Italy; and no doubt it suits her
too to some extent to consider Denmark, for Denmark commands
the entrance to the Baltic; and, further, Germany does not wish to
bring all Scandinavia down upon herself just at present. That can
wait; but Holland is in the worst plight of all. She has the terrible
spectacle of Belgium, ruined and ravaged just on the other side of
the way. And she has a very considerable and valuable mercantile
marine.</p>

<p>The great and good Germany cannot be troubled to distinguish
between Dutch and other boats, and if occasionally a Dutch ship is
captured or sent to the bottom, it is a useful reminder of what she
might do to her “poor relation” if she really let herself go. Fighting
for the freedom of the seas! Holland has fought for them herself.
Holland has a great naval tradition. She knows quite well what
England has been and is. She knows too, and can see, how her sons
and brothers in South Africa were treated by the British in England’s
last war, and how they regard England and Germany now.</p>

<p>Raemaekers’ cartoon is very skilful. If we had not seen it
done, we should not have believed it possible to produce at once so
clever a likeness of von Tirpitz and so excellent an old fox. But
the goose is by no means a foolish bird, though its wisdom may sometimes
be shown in knowing its own weakness. It was they, and not
the watch-dogs, that saved the Capitol. In old days it was the custom
to call the Germans the “High Dutch” and the inhabitants of
Holland the “Low Dutch.” It was a geographical distinction. The
contrast in moral elevation is the other way.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A vile</span> feature of German “frightfulness” is this: that she
mixes poison with her prisoners’ rations. Not content with
starving their bodies, she hides truth from them and floods
their minds with lies. Those in command—officers, educated men,
claiming the service of their soldiers and civil guard and the respect
of their nation—deliberately hash a daily meal of falsehood and serve
up German victories and triumphs on land and sea as sauce to the
starvation diet of their defenceless captives.</p>

<p>In the earlier months of the war, while yet the spiritual slough into
which Germany had sunk was unguessed, and the mixture of child and
devil exemplified by “frightfulness” continued unfathomed, these
daily lies undoubtedly answered their cowardly purpose, cast down
the spirit of thousands, and added another pang to their captivity.
But our armies know better now, and those diminishing numbers
likely to be taken prisoner in the future see the end more clearly than
the foe can. Lies will be met with laughter henceforth, for our enemies
have put themselves beyond the pale. They may starve and insult
our bodies; but their power to poison our brains has passed from
them for ever. We know them at last. They have spun a web of
barbed villainy between their souls and ours; and the evil committed
for one foul purpose alone—to terrify free men and break the spirit of
the sons of liberty—has produced results far different and created a
situation more terrible for them than for their outraged enemies.</p>

<p>For in this matter of misrepresentation and lying, born of Prussia
and by her spoon-fed pack of martinets, professors, and Churchmen,
mingled with Germany’s daily bread for a generation, it is she and
not we who will reap the whirlwind of that sowing; it is she and not
we who must soon pant and tear the breast in the pangs of the
poison.</p>

<p>Between the mad and the sane there can be only one victor; and
when the time comes, may Germany’s robe of repentance be a strait-waistcoat
of the Allies’ choosing. For she has drunk deep of the
poison, and those who anticipate a speedy cure will be as mad as
she. When the escaped tigress is back in her cage, men look to the
bars, for none wants a second mauling.</p>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I am</span> not sure that in this cartoon of Raemaekers the most
pleasing detail is not the servant’s right eye. You will observe
in that servant’s right eye an expression familiar in those who
overhear this sort of comment upon the peculiar bestialities of the
Prussian in Belgium and Poland, this extenuation of his baseness.
When the war was young the opportunity for giving that glance was
commoner than it is now. There were many even in a belligerent
country who would tell you in superior fashion how foolishly
exaggerated were the so-called “atrocities.” The greater number of
such men (and women) talked of “two Germanies”—one the nice
Germany they knew and loved so well, and the other apparently nasty
Germany which raped, burned, stole, broke faith, tortured, and the
rest. Their number has diminished. But there is a little lingering
trace of the sort of thing still to be discovered: men and women who
hope against hope that the Prussian will really prove good at heart
after all. And it is usually just after some expression of the kind
that the most appalling news arrives with a terrible irony to
punctuate their folly. It reminds one a little of the man in the
story who was sure that he could tame a wild cat, and was in the act
of recording its virtues when it flew in his face. To an impartial
observer who cared nothing for our sufferings or the enemy’s vices,
there would be something enormously comic in the vision of these few
remaining (for there are still some few remaining) that approach the
wild beast with soothing words and receive as their only reward a very
large bomb through the roof of their house, or the news that someone
dear to them has been murdered on the high seas. But to those
actively suffering in the struggle the comic element is difficult to seize,
and it is replaced by indignation. This fantastic misconception of the
thing that is being fought is bound to be burned right out by the
realities of the enemy acts in belligerent countries. It will be similarly
destroyed—and that in no very great space of time—in all neutral
countries as well. Prussia will have it so. She is allowing no moral
defence to remain for her future. It is almost as though the men
now directing her affairs lent ear carefully to every word spoken in
praise of them abroad, and met it at once by the tremendous denial
of example. It is almost as though the Prussian felt it a sort of
personal insult to receive the praise of dupes and fools, and perhaps
it is.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> war has produced examples of every kind of misery which
human beings can inflict upon each other, except one. Europe
has mercifully been spared long sieges of populous towns, ending
in the surrender of the starving population. But many towns and
villages have been burnt; and masses of refugees have fled before the
invader, knowing too well the brutal treatment which they had to
expect if they remained. Very many of the unhappy Belgians
have taken refuge in Holland; a considerable number have found
an asylum in this country. They are homeless and ruined; if the
war were to end to-morrow, many of them would not know where
to go or how to live. Families have been broken up; husbands
and wives, parents and children, are ignorant of each other’s fate.
In this picture we see a crowd of children, herded together like a

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Prussia</span> in every war has betrayed that peculiar mark of
barbarism consisting in using the intellectual weapons of a
superior, but not knowing how to use them. It is still a
matter of mystery to the directing Prussian mind why the sinking
of the <i>Lusitania</i> should have shocked the world. A submarine cannot
take a prize into port. The <i>Lusitania</i> happened to be importing
goods available in war, therefore the <i>Lusitania</i> must be sunk. All
the penumbræ of further consideration which the civilised man weighs
escape this sort of logic. Similarly, the Prussian argues, if an armed
man is prepared to surrender, convention decrees that his life should
be spared. Therefore, if an armed man be just fresh from the murder
of a number of children, he has but to cry “Kamerad” to be perfectly
safe. And Prussia foams at the mouth with indignation whenever
this strict rule of conduct is forgotten in the heat of the moment.
The use of poison in the field which Prussia for the first time employed
(and reluctantly compelled her civilised opponents to reply to) is in
the same boat. A shell bursts because solid explosive becomes
gaseous. To use shell which in bursting wounds and kills men is to
use gas in war; therefore if one uses gas in the other form of poison,
disabling one’s opponent with agony, it is all one. Precisely the same
barbaric use of logic—which reminds one of the antics of an animal
imitating human gestures—will later apply to the poisoning of water
supplies, or the spreading of an epidemic. It is soldierly and excites
no contempt or indignation to strike at your enemy with a sword or
shoot a pellet of lead at him in such a fashion that he dies. What is all
this foolish pother about killing him with bacilli in his cisterns or with
a drop of poison in his tea? Men in war have burned groups of houses
with the torch in anger or for revenge. Why distinguish between that
and the methodical sprinkling of petroleum from a hose by one gang
and the equally methodical burning of the whole town house by house
with little capsules of prepared incendiary stuff? The rule always
applies—but only against the opponent: never to oneself. From that
attitude of mind the Prussian will never emerge. We shall, please God,
see that mood in all its beauty in later stages of the war, when the
coercion of the Prussian upon his own soil leads to acts indefensible
by Prussian logic. We have already had a taste of this sort of
reasoning when the royalties fled from Karlsruhe and when the murderers
upon the sinking Zeppelin received the reward due to men
who boast that they will not keep faith.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Most</span> of the English caricaturists are much too complimentary
to the German Emperor. They draw his moustaches, but
not his face. Now his moustaches are exactly what he,
or the whole Prussian school he represents, particularly wishes us to
look at. They give him the fierce air of a fighting cock; and
however little we may like fierceness, there will always be a certain
residual respect for fighting, even in a cock. Now the Junker
moustache is a fake; almost as much so as if it were stuck on with
gum. It is, as Mr. Belloc has remarked, curled in a machine all night
lest it should hang down. Raemaekers, in the sketch which
shows the Kaiser as waiting for Nurse Cavell’s death to say, “Now
you can bring me the American protest,” has gone behind the
moustache to the face, and behind the face to the type and the spirit.
The Emperor is not commanding in a lordly voice from a throne,
but with a leer and behind a curtain. In the few lines of the lean
unnatural face is written the real history of the Hohenzollerns, the
kind of history not often touched on in our comfortable English
humour, but common to the realism of Continental art: the madness
of Frederick William, the perversion of Frederick the Great, the hint,
mingled with subtler talents, of the mere idiocy that seems to have
flowered again in the last heir of that inhuman house. The Hohenzollerns
have varied from generation to generation in many things
and like many families; some of them have been tyrants, some of
them geniuses, some of them merely boobies; but they have shared
in something more than that hereditary policy which has been the
poison in Christendom for two hundred years. There is a ghost who
inhabits these perishing tenements, and in such a picture as this of
Raemaekers’ men can see it looking out of the eyes. And it is neither
the spirit of a tyrant nor of a booby; but the spirit of a sly invalid.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Ay</span>, boy—you may well ask.</p>

<p>And the world asks also, and in due time will exact
an answer—to the last drop of innocent blood.</p>

<p>What have you done?</p>

<p>You have fallen into the hands of the most scientifically organised
barbarism the world has ever seen, or, please God, ever will see—to
whom, of deliberate choice, such words as truth, honour, mercy, justice,
have become dead letters, by reason of the pernicious doctrines on
which the race has been nourished—by which its very soul has been
poisoned.</p>

<p>Dead letters?—worn-out rags, the very virtues they once represented,
even in Germany, long since flung to the dust-heaps of the past
in the soulless scramble for power and a place in the sun which no one
denied her.</p>

<p>Deliberately, and of malice prepense, the military caste of Prussia
has taught, and the unhappy common-folk have accepted, that as a
nation they are past all that kind of thing. There is only one right in
the world—the might of the strongest. The weak to the wall! Make
way for the Hun, whose god is power, and his high-priests the Kaiser
and the Krupps.</p>

<p>And so, every nation, even the smallest, on whom the eye of the
Minotaur has settled in baleful desire, has said, “Better to die fighting
than fall into the hands of the devil!” And they have fought—valiantly,
and saved their souls alive, though their bodies may have
been crushed out of existence by overwhelming odds. As nations,
however, they shall rise again, and with honour, when their treacherous
torturers have been crushed in their turn.</p>

<p>And, wherever the evil tide has welled over a land, indemnities,
incredible and unreasonable, have been exacted, and hostages for their
payment, and for good behaviour under the yoke meanwhile, have
been taken.</p>

<p>Woe unto such! In many cases they have simply been shot in
cold blood—murdered as brazenly as by any Jack-the-Ripper. Murder,
too, of the most despicable—murder for gain—the gain that should accrue
through the brutal terrorism of the act and its effect on the rest.</p>

<p>And, if deemed advisable to gloss the crime with some thin veneer
of imitation justice for the—unsuccessful—hoodwinking of a shocked
and astounded world, what easier than an unseen shot in some obscure
corner from a German rifle? Then—“Death to the hostages!—destruction
to the village!—a fine of £100,000 on the town!”</p>

<p>Those provocative shots from German rifles have surely been the
most profitably engineered basenesses in the whole war. They have
justified—but in German eyes only—every committable crime, and they
cost nothing—except the souls of their perpetrators.</p>

<p>“It’s your money we want—and your land—and your property—and,
if necessary, your lives! You are weak—we are strong—and
so——!” That is the simple Credo of the Hun.</p>

<p>But for all these things there shall come a day of reckoning and
the account will be a heavy one.</p>

<p>May it be exacted to the full—from the rightful debtors!</p>

<p>“What have you done?” You have at all events put the rope
round the necks of your murderers, and the whole world’s hands are at
the other end of it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> war has been singularly barren of heroic figures, perhaps
because the magnitude of the events has called forth such
a multitude of individually heroic acts that no one can be
placed before the rest; yet, when this greatest phase of history
comes to be written down with historic perspective, one figure—that
of King Albert of Belgium—will stand as that of a twentieth-century
Bayard, a great knight without fear and without reproach.</p>

<p>Action on such far-flung lines as those of the European conflict
has called for no great leaders in the sense in which that phrase has
applied to previous wars; no Napoleon has arisen, though William
Hohenzollern has aspired to Napoleonic dignity; war has become
more mechanical, more a matter of mathematics—and the barbarians
of Germany have made it more horrible. But, as if to accentuate
German brutality and crime, this figure of King Albert stands
emblematic of the virtues in which civilisation is rooted; to the
broken word of Germany it opposes untarnished honour; to the
treacherous spirit of Germany it opposes inviolable truth; to the
relentless selfishness of Germany it opposes the vicarious sacrifice
of self, of a whole country and nation for the sake of a principle.
And, in later days, men will remember how this truly great king
held steadfastly to the little portion of his kingdom that the invasion
left him; how he remained to inspirit his men by noble example,
stubbornly rejecting peace without honour, and holding, when all
else was wrecked, to the remnants of that army which saved Europe
in the gateway of Liége. Amid violation, desecration, and destruction,
Albert of Belgium has won imperishable fame.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is an order of minds that intuitively distrusts Science,
detracts from the force of her achievements, and contends
that devotion to machinery ends by making men machines.
Many who argue thus have fastened on Germany’s new war inventions
as proof that Science makes for materialism and opposes the higher
values of humanity and culture.</p>

<p>This is special pleading, for against the destructive forces discovered
and liberated by German chemists in this war, one has only
to consider the vast amelioration of human life for which modern
science has to be thanked. Because art has been created to evil
purpose, shall we condemn pictures, or statues? Because the Germans
have employed gas poisons in warfare, are we to condemn the
incalculable gifts of organic chemistry?</p>

<p>Look at the eye of Louis Raemaekers’ snake. That is the answer.
It is the force behind this application of it that has brought German
Science to shame. A precious branch of human knowledge has been
prostituted by lust of blood and greed of gain until Science, in common
with all learning, comes simply to be regarded by the masters of
Germany as one more weapon in the armoury, one more power to help
win “The Day.” Every culture is treated in their alembic for the
same purpose.</p>

<p>We may picture the series of experiments that went to perfection
of their poison gas; we may see their Higher Command watching the
death of guinea-pig, rabbit, and ape with increasing excitement and
enthusiasm as the hideous effects of their discovery became apparent.
Be sure an iron cross quickly hung over the iron heart that conceived
and developed this filthy arm; for does it not offer the essence—quintessence
of all “frightfulness”? Does it not challenge every
human nerve-centre by its horror? Does it not, once proclaimed, by
anticipation awake those very emotions of dread and dismay that make
the stroke more fatal when it falls?</p>

<p>These people pictured their snake paralysing the enemy into
frozen impotence; the floundering Prussian psychology that cuts blocks
with a razor and regards German mind as the measure of all mind,
anticipated that poison gas would appeal to British and French as it
had appealed to them. But it was not so. Their foresight gave them
an initial success in the field; it slew a handful of men with additions
of unspeakable agony—and rekindled the execration and contempt of
Civilisation.</p>

<p>As an arm, poison gas cannot be considered conspicuously
successful, since it is easily countered; but for the Allies it had some
value, since it weighted appreciably the scale against Germany in
neutral minds and added to the universal loathing astir at the heart
of the world. Only fear now holds any kingdom neutral: there is not
an impartial nation left on earth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A blonde</span> woman, wearing the Imperial crown and with her
hair braided in pigtails like a German <i lang="de">backfisch</i>, is whirling
in the tango with a skeleton partner. Her face is livid with
terror and fatigue, her limbs are drooping, but she is held by inexorable
bony claws. On the feet of the skeleton are dancing pumps, a touch
which adds to the grimness. This ghoulish dance does not lack its
element of ghastly ceremonial.</p>

<p>The Dance of Death has long been the theme of the moralist in
art, from Orcagna’s fresco on the walls of the Campo Santo at Pisa
to Holbein’s great woodcuts and our own Rowlandson. In Germany
especially have these <em>macabre</em> imaginings flourished. The phantasmagoria
of decay has haunted German art, as it haunted Poe, from Dürer
to Boecklin. But the mediæval Dance of Death was stately allegory,
showing the pageant of life brooded over by the shadow of mortality.
In M. Raemaekers’ cartoon there is no dignity, no lofty resignation.
He shows Death summoned in a mad caprice and kept as companion
till the revel becomes a whirling horror.</p>

<p>It is the profoundest symbol of the war. In a hot fit of racial
pride Death has been welcomed as an ally. And the dance on which
Germany enters is no stately minuet with something of tragic dignity
in it. It is a common modern vulgar shuffle, a thing of ugly gestures
and violent motions, the true sport of degenerates. Once begun there
is no halting. From East to West and from West to East the dancers
move. There is no rest, for Death is a pitiless comrade. From such a
partner, lightly and arrogantly summoned, there can be no parting.
The traveller seeks a goal, but the dancers move blindly and aimlessly
among the points of the compass. Death, when called to the dance,
claims eternal possession.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the future historian gives to another age his account
of all that is included in German “frightfulness,” there is
no feature upon which he will dilate more emphatically
than the extraordinary use made by the enemy of their Zeppelin fleet.
In the experience we have gained in the last few months we discover
that the Zeppelins are not employed—or, at all events, not mainly employed—for
military purposes, but in order to shake the nerves of the
non-combatant population. The history of the last few Zeppelin
raids in England is quite sufficient testimony to this fact. London
is bombarded, although it is an open city, and a large amount of damage
is done to buildings wholly unconnected with the purposes of the war.
The persons who are killed are not soldiers, they are civilians; the
buildings destroyed are not munition works, but dwelling-houses,
and some of the points of attack are theatres.</p>

<p>The same thing has happened in the provinces. In the last raid
over the Midlands railway stations were destroyed, some breweries
were injured, but, with exceedingly few exceptions, munition works
and factories for the production of arms were untouched. Here again
the victims are not either soldiers or sailors, or even workmen employed
in turning out instruments of war, but peaceable citizens and a large
proportion of women and children.</p>

<p>Some such act of brutality is illustrated in the accompanying
cartoon. A private house has been attacked, the mother has been
killed, the father and child are left desolate. The little daughter at
her father’s knee, who cannot understand why guiltless people should
suffer, asks the importunate question whether her mother had done
anything wrong to deserve so terrible a fate. To the childish mind
it seems incomprehensible that aimless and indiscriminate murder
should fall on the guiltless.</p>

<p>Indeed the mother had done no wrong. She only happened to
belong to one of the nations who are struggling against a barbaric
tyranny. In that reckless crusade which the Central Powers are
waging against all the higher laws of morality and civilisation, some of
the heaviest of the blows fall on the defenceless. It is this appalling
inhumanity, this godless desire to maim and wound and kill, which
nerves the arms of the Allies, who know that in a case like this they
are fighting for freedom and for the Divine laws of mercy and loving-kindness.</p>

<p>And it is for the young especially that the war is being waged,
young boys and young girls like the motherless child in the picture,
in order that they may inherit a Europe which shall be free from the
horrible burden of German militarism, and be able to live useful lives
in peace and quietness. No, little girl, mother did no wrong! But
we should be guilty of the deepest wrong if we did not avenge her death
and that of other similar victims by making such unparalleled crimes
impossible hereafter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Prussian turns everything to account, from the scrapings
of the pig-trough to the Austrian Emperor.</p>

<p>The Bavarian lists, the Saxon lists, the Austrian lists—these
are all only indications of injuries to the Prussian’s life-saving
waistcoat. If this war is to be a war to the last penny and the last man,
the last Austrian will die before the last Saxon, the last Saxon before
the last Bavarian, the last Bavarian before the last Prussian—and the
last Prussian will not die: he will live to clutch at the last penny.</p>

<p>And the pity of it is that the Austrian is quite a good fellow, the
Saxon is a decent sort of man, the Bavarian is chiefly a brute in drink,
whilst the Prussian—we all know what the Prussian is, the black
centre of hardness, the incarnation of the shady trick, and the very
complex soul of mechanical efficiency.</p>

<p>The Hohenzollern here makes a sandbag of the Hapsburg, of whom
Fate has already made a football.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_German_Offer">The German Offer</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> German claim—not the Austrian nor the Turk, for the
alliance following Germany is to be allowed little force—is that,
the civilisation of Europe now being defeated, a Roman pride
may be generous to the fallen. Before modern Germany is routed,
as may be seen in the features of its citizens, the nobility of its public
works, and the admirable, restrained, and classic sense of its literature,
this generosity to a humbled world will take the form of letting nations,
of right independent, enjoy some measure of freedom under a German
suzerainty. In the matter of property the magnanimous descendants
of Frederick and William the Great will restore the machines which
cannot be wrenched from their concrete beds, and the walls of the
manufactories. More liquid property, such as jewellery, furniture,
pictures—and coin—it will be more difficult to trace. In any case,
Europe may breathe again, though with a shorter breath than it did
before Germany conquered at the Marne.... This is the majestic
vision which the subtle diplomats of Berlin present to the admiration
of the neutral Powers, happily free from wicked passions of war, and not
blinded, as are the British, French, Russians, Italians, Belgians, and the
Serbians, by petty spite. Their audience, their triple audience, is
part of Greece, some of the public of Spain, and sections of that of
the United States. To the French and the British armies in the West,
to the Russians in the East, and to the Italians upon their frontiers,
the terms appear insufficient. Therein would seem to lie the gravity
of Prussia’s case. These belligerent Powers will go so far as to demand
more than the mere restoration of stolen property, from cottage furniture
to freedom. And their anger has risen so high that they even propose
to make the acquirer of these goods suffer very bitterly indeed. What
plea he will then raise under discomforts more serious than those he
has caused to the peasants of Flanders and of Poland, and how those
pleas will affect his neutral audience, will have no effect whatever on the
result of the war, or on his own unpleasing fate. Those appeals will have
a certain interest, however, because we know from the past that the
German mind is unstable. Within fifteen short months it proposed the
annihilation of the French armies and the occupation of Paris. It failed.
It next offered terms upon suffering defeat. It withdrew them. It next
made certain at least of a conquest of Russia, failed again, offered terms
again, withdrew them again; was directed to the blockading of England,
failed; thought Egypt better, and then changed its mind. It was but
yesterday in the mood that this cartoon suggests; to-morrow its mood
will have utterly changed again, probably to a whine, perhaps to a
scream. Such instability is rare in the history of nations which propose
a conquest of others, and it is a very poor furniture for the mind.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> wolf is not perhaps the beast by which one would most
wish one’s country to be represented. But the wolf, like every
animal when defending its dearest, and when assailed with
treachery, has its nobility. And the Roman she-wolf certainly has
had in all ages her dignity and her force.</p>

<p>Italy certainly calls not only for our sympathy, but for our admiration.
She has had a very difficult course to steer. The ally for so
long of Germany and Austria, if owing them less and less as time went
on, it was difficult for her to break with them. But the day came
when she had to break with them, and once again “act for herself.”
She told them a year ago she would be a party to no aggressive or selfish
war, she would be no bully’s accomplice. She “denounced”—it is
a good word—such a compact. <i lang="la">Non haec in fœdera veni.</i></p>

<p>Then it was, when the she-wolf showed her teeth, that they offered
to give her what was her own. But what would the Trentino be worth
if Germany and Austria were victorious? No, the wolf is right, “she
must fight for it,” and behind Austria’s underhanded treachery stands
Germany’s open violence and guns.</p>

<p>And Italy loves freedom. This war is a war made by her people.
As of old her King and her diplomats go with them in this new
<i lang="it">Resorgimento</i>. And the she-wolf must beware the trap. She needs the
spirit again not only of her people and of Garibaldi and of Victor
Emmanuel, but of Cavour. And she has it.</p>

<p>The cartoon suggests all the elements of the situation. The wolf
ponders with turned head, half doubtful, half desperate. The poor
little cub whimpers pitifully. The hunters dissemble their craft, the
trap waits in the path ready to spring. It is not even concealed. Is
that the irony of the artist, or is it only due to the necessity of making
his meaning plain? Whichever it is, it is justified.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> legend of the Wandering Jew obsessed the imagination
of the Middle Age. The tale, which an Armenian bishop first
told at the Abbey of St. Albans, concerned a doorkeeper in
the house of Pontius Pilate—or, as some say, a shoemaker in Jerusalem—who
insulted Christ on His way to Calvary. He was told by Our
Lord, “I will rest, but thou shalt go on till the Last Day.” Christendom
saw the strange figure in many places—at Hamburg and Leipsic and
Lubeck, at Moscow and Madrid, even at far Baghdad. Goodwives
in the little mediæval cities, hastening homeward against the rising
storm, saw a bent figure posting through the snow, with haggard face
and burning eyes, carrying his load of penal immortality, and seeking
in vain for “easeful death.” There is a profound metaphysic in such
popular fancies. Good and evil are alike eternal. Arthur and Charlemagne
and Ogier the Dane are only sleeping and will yet return to save
their peoples; and the Wandering Jew staggers blindly through the
ages, seeking the rest which he denied to his Lord.</p>

<p>In George Meredith’s “Odes in Contribution to the Song of French
History” there is a famous passage on Napoleon. France, disillusioned
at last,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Perceives him fast to a harsher Tyrant bound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Self-ridden, self-hunted, captive of his aim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Material grandeur’s ape, the Infernal’s hound.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is the penalty of mortal presumption. The Superman who
would shatter the homely decencies of mankind and set his foot on the
world’s neck is himself bound captive. He is the slave of the djinn
whom he has called from the unclean deeps. There can be no end
to his quest. Weariness does not bring peace, for the whips of the
Furies are in his own heart.</p>

<p>The Wandering Jew of the Middle Age was a figure sympathetically
conceived. He had still to pay the price in his tortured body, but
his soul was at rest, for he had repented his folly. Raemaekers
in his cartoon follows the conception of Gustave Doré rather than
that of the old fabulists. The modern Ahasuerus has no surety of
an eventual peace. We have seen the German War Lord flitting hungrily
from Lorraine to Poland, from Flanders to Nish, watching the failure
of his troops before Nancy and Ypres, inditing grandiose proclamations
to Europe, prophesying a peace which never comes. He is a figure
worthy of Greek tragedy. The [Greek: hubris] which defied the gods has put
him outside the homely consolations of mankind. He has devoted
his people to the Dance of Death, and himself, like some new Orestes,
can find no solace though he seek it wearily in the four corners of the
world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> position of Holland and Denmark is one of excruciating
anxiety to the citizens of those countries. They know that
the Allies are fighting the battle of their own political existence,
but they are so hypnotised with well-founded terror of the implacable
tyrant on their flank that they are not only bound to neutrality, but are
afraid to express their sympathies too plainly. Dutch editors have
been admonished and punished under pressure from Berlin; the
brilliant artist of these cartoons is in danger on his native soil. A
leading German newspaper has lately announced that “we will make
Holland pay with interest for these insults after the war.” A German
victory would inevitably be followed in a few years by the disappearance
from the map of this gallant and interesting little nation, our plucky
rival in time past, our honoured friend to-day. No nation has
established a stronger claim to maintain its independence, whether we
consider the heroic and successful struggles of the Dutch for religious
and political liberty, their triumphs in discovery, colonisation, and
naval warfare, their unique contributions to art, or the manly and
vigorous character of their people. It is needless to say that we have
no designs upon any Dutch colony!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Here</span> is pictured a grim fact that the Peace cranks would
do well to see plainly. The surgeon who is operating on a
cancer case cannot allow himself to be satisfied with merely
the removal of the visible growth which is causing such present agony
to the patient. He must cut and cut deep, must go beyond even the
visible roots of the disease, slice down into the clear, firm flesh to
make sure and doubly sure that he has cut away the last fragment of
the tainted tissues. Only by doing so can he reasonably hope to
prevent a recurrence of the disease and the necessity of another operation
in the years to come. And so only by carrying on this war until
the last and least possibility of the taint of militarism remaining in
the German system is removed can the Allies be satisfied that their
task is complete. Modern surgery has through anæsthetics taken away
from a patient the physical pain of most operations, but modern War
affords no relief during its operation. That, however, can be held
as no excuse for refusing to “use the knife.” What would be said of
the surgeon who, because an operation—a life-saving operation—was
causing at the time even the utmost agony, stayed his hand, patched
up the wound, was content only to stop the momentary pain, and to
leave firm-rooted a disease which in all human probability would some
time later break out again in all its virulence? What would be said
of such a surgeon is only in lesser degree what would be said by posterity
of the Allies if they consented or were persuaded to apply the bandage
and healing herbs of Peace to the disease of Militarism, to make a surface
cure and leave the living tentacles of the disease to grow again deep
and strong. But here at least the doctors do not disagree. Once and
for all the Ally surgeons mean to make an end to Militarism. The
sooner the Peace cranks and Germany realise that the sooner the
operation will be over.</p>

<p>In August and September, 1914, Prussia, by the seizure of Belgium,
developed a lower jaw-bone reaching from Aix-la-Chapelle to Cassandria
on the West Schelde. To-day Holland lies gripped between these
two formidable mandibles that are ready and waiting to close and
crush her. For years and years Prussia has been waiting to devour
Holland. Why? For the simple reason that Holland is rich in the
one essential thing that Prussia lacks—coast-line.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Raemaekers pictures Von Tirpitz to us, he does so
with savage scorn. He is not the hard-bitten pirate of
story—but a senile, crapulous, lachrymose imbecile; an
object of derision. He fits more with one of Jacobs’s tales of longshore
soakers, than with the tragedies that have made him infamous.
But when he draws Von Tirpitz’s victims, the touch is one of almost
harrowing tenderness. The Hun is a master of many modes of killing,
but however torn, or twisted, or tortured he leaves the murdered,
Raemaekers can make the dreadful spectacle bearable by the piercing
dignity with which he portrays the dead. In none of these cartoons
is his <i lang="la">sæva indignatio</i> rendered with more sheer beauty of design, or
with a craftsmanship more exquisite, than in this monument to the
sea-mined prey. The symbolism is perfect, and of the essence of the
design. The dead sink slowly to their resting-place, but the merciful
twilight of the sea veils from us the glazed horror of the eyes that
no piety can now close. Even the dumb senseless fish shoots from the
scene in mute and terrified protest, while from these poor corpses
there rise surfaceward the silver bubbles of their expiring breath.
One seems to see crying human souls prisoned in these spheres. And
it is, indeed, such sins as these that cry to Heaven for vengeance.
Blood-guiltiness must rest upon the heads of those that do them, upon
the heads of their children—aye, and of their children’s children too.
This exquisite and tender drawing is something more than the record
of inexpiable crime. It is a prophecy. And the prophecy is a curse.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cartoon in which the Prussian is depicted as saying to his
bound and gagged victim, “Ain’t I a lovable fellow?” is one
of the most pointed and vital of all pictorial, or indeed other,
criticisms on the war. It is very important to note that German savagery
has not interfered at all with German sentimentalism. The blood of
the victim and the tears of the victor flow together in an unpleasing
stream. The effect on a normal mind of reading some of the things
the Germans say, side by side with some of the things they do, is an
impression that can quite truly be conveyed only in the violent paradox
of the actual picture. It is exactly like being tortured by a man with
an ugly face, which we slowly realise to be contorted in an attempt
at an affectionate expression. In those soliloquies of self-praise which
have constituted almost the whole of Prussia’s defence in the international
controversy, the brigand of the Belgian annexation has
incessantly said that his apparent hardness is the necessary accompaniment
of his inherent strength. Nietzsche said: “I give you a new
commandment: Be hard.” And the Prussian says: “I am hard,”
in a prompt and respectful manner. But, as a matter of fact, he is
not hard; he is only heavy. He is not indifferent to all feelings;
he is only indifferent to everybody else’s feelings. At the thought
of his own virtues he is always ready to burst into tears. His smiles,
however, are even more frequent and more fatuous than his tears;
and they are all leers like that which Mr. Raemaekers has drawn on the
face of the expansive Prussian officer in the arm-chair. Compared
with such an exhibition, there is something relatively virile about the
tiger cruelty which has occasionally defaced the record of the Spaniard
or the Arab. But to be conquered by such Germans as these would
be like being eaten by slugs.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> recent descent of so many of her citizens from the people now
warring in Europe has of necessity prevented America from
looking on events in Europe with a single eye. But the predominant
American type and the predominant American frame of mind
are still typified by the lithe and sinuous figure of the New England
pioneer. It is his tradition to mind his own business, but it is also
his business to see that none of the old monarchies make free with
his rights or with his people. And he stands for a race that has been
cradled in wars with savages. No one knows better the methods of
the Apache and the Mohawk, and when women and children fall into
such pitiless hands as these, it goes against the grain with Uncle Sam
to keep his hands off them, even if the women and children are not
his own. He would like to be indifferent if he could. He would
prefer to smoke his cigar, and pass along, and believe those who tell
him that it is none of his affair. But when he does look—and he
cannot help looking—he sees a figure of such heavy bestiality that his
gorge rises. He must keep his hands clenched in his pockets lest he
soils them in striking down the blood-stained gnome before him.</p>

<p>Can he restrain himself for good? That angry glint in his eye
would make one doubt it. Here, surely, the artist sees with a truer
vision than the politician. And if Uncle Sam’s anger does once get
the better of him, if doubts and hesitations are ever thrust on one
side, if he takes his stand where his record and his sympathies must
make him wish to be, then let it be noted that this base butcher stands
dazed and paralysed by the threat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is the essence of great cartooning to see things simply, and to
command the technical resources that shall show the things,
so simply seen, in an infinite variety of aspects. No series of
Raemaekers’ drawings better exemplifies his quality in both these
respects than those which deal with Germany’s sea crimes.</p>

<p>In the cartoon before us the immediate message is of the simplest.
The Kaiser counts the head of British merchantmen sunk. Von
Tirpitz counts the cost. But note the subtlety of the personation and
environment. The Kaiser has those terrible haunted eyes that have
marked the seer’s presentment of him from quite an early stage of the
war. There can be no ultimate escape from the dreadful vision that
has set the seal of despair on this fine and handsome visage. He is
shown, not as a sea monster, but as some rabid, evasive, impatient
thing, dashing from point to point—as from policy to policy—with
the angry swish that tells the unspoken anger failure everywhere
compels. For the victories do not bring surrender, nor does frightfulness
inspire terror. The merchant ships still put to sea—and the
U boats pay the penalty.</p>

<p>The futility of this campaign of murder is typified by making
von Tirpitz, its inventor, an addle-headed seahorse, the nursery
comedian of the sea. Stupid and ridiculous bewilderment stares from
his foolish eyes. Another submarine has failed to find a safe victim
in a trading ship, but has been hoisted with its own sea petard.
The impotence of the thing!</p>

<p>This conference of the Admirals of the Atlantic, held in the sombre
depths, is a biting satire, in its mingled comedy and tragedy, on the
effort to win command of the sea from its bottom.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Italy, still straining at the leash which held her, helpless,
to the strange and unnatural Triplice, began to show signs
of awakening consciousness, Germany’s efforts to lull her back
to the unhappy position of silent partner in the world-crime
were characteristic of her methods. Forthwith Italy was loaded with
compliments. The country was overrun with “diplomats,” which is
another name in Germany for spies. Bribery of the most brazen sort
was attempted. The newspapers recalled in chorus that Italy was
the land of art and chivalry, of song and heroism, of fabled story and
manly effort, of honour and loyalty. Hark to the <i>Hamburger Fremdenblatt</i>
of February 21st, <span class="locked">1915:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The suggestion is made that Italy favours the Allies. Preposterous!
Even though the palsied hand of England—filled with robber
gold—be held out to her, Italy’s vows, Italy’s sense of obligation,
Italy’s <em>word once given</em>, can never be broken. Such a nation of
noblemen could have no dealings with hucksters.”</p>
</div>

<p>Germany is, indeed, a fine judge of a nation’s “word once given”
and a nation’s “vows,” which its Chancellor unblushingly declared
to be mere scraps of paper. Now let us see what the <i>Hamburger
Nachrichten</i> had to say about Italy immediately after her secession
from the Triple Alliance:—“<i>Nachrichten</i>, June 1st, 1915.—That
Italy should have joined hands with the other noble gentlemen, our
enemies, is but natural. It would, of course, be absurd—where all are
brigands—were the classical name of brigandage not included in the
number.... We do not propose to soil our clean steel with the
blood of such filthy Italian scum. With our cudgels we shall smash
them into pulp.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de">Gott strafe Italien</i>” indeed! Bombs on St. Mark’s in Venice,
on the Square of Verona, on world treasures unreplaceable. The
poisoned breath of Germany carries its venom into the land of sunshine
and song, whose best day’s work in history has been to wrest
itself free from the grip of the false friend.</p>

portrays as a hound lapping up the victim’s blood, is fated to share the
punishment for the crime. But the prime instigator is the German
Emperor, whose Chancellor, with bitter irony, claims for his master
the title of protector of the small nationalities of Europe. Herr von
Bethmann-Hollweg can on occasion affect the mincing accents of the
wolf when that beast seeks to lull the cries of the lamb in its clutches.
The German method of waging war has rendered “dreadful objects
so familiar” that the essential brutality of the enemy’s activities
runs a risk of escaping at times the strenuous denunciation which
Justice demands. But the searching pencil of Mr. Raemaekers brings
home to every seeing eye the true and unvarying character of Teutonic
“frightfulness.” All instincts of humanity are cynically defied on the
specious ground of military necessity. Mr. Raemaekers is at one with
Milton in repudiating the worthless plea:</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Here</span> is a drawing that ought to be circulated broadcast
throughout Australia and New Zealand, that ought to hold
a place of honour on the walls of their public chambers; should
hang in gilded frames in the houses of the rich; be pinned to
the rough walls of frame-house and bark humpy in every corner of
“The Outback.” It should thrill the heart of every man, woman, and
child Down Under with pride and thankfulness and satisfaction, should
even bring soothing balm to the wounds of those who in the loss of
their nearest and dearest have paid the highest and the deepest price
for the flaming glory of the Anzacs in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Here in the artist’s pencil is a monument to those heroes greater
than pinnacles of marble, of beaten brass and carven stone; a
monument that has travelled over the world, has spoken to posterity
more clearly, more convincingly, and more rememberingly than ever
written or word-of-mouth speech could do. It is to the everlasting
honour of the people of the Anzacs that they refrained from echoing
the idle tales which ran whispering in England that the Dardanelles
campaign was a cruel blunder, that the blood of the Anzacs’ bravest
and best had been uselessly spilt, that their splendid young lives
had been an empty sacrifice to the demons of Incompetence and
Inefficiency. To those in Australia who in their hearts may feel that
shreds of truth were woven in the rumours—that the Anzacs were
spent on a forlorn hope, were wasted on a task foredoomed to
failure—let this simple drawing bring the comfort of the truth.</p>

<p>The artist has seen deeper and further than most. The Turkish
armies held from pouring on Russia and Serbia, from thumping down
the scales of neutrality in Greece and Roumania perhaps, from massing
their troops with the Central Powers; the Kaiser chained on the East
and West for the critical months when men and munitions were
desperately lacking to the Allies, when the extra weight of the Turks
might have freed the Kaiser’s power of fierce attack on East and
West—this is what we already know, what the artist here tells the wide
world of the part played by the heroes of the Dardanelles. In face
of this, who dare hint they suffered and died in vain?</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Surely</span> the artist when he drew this was endowed with the
wisdom of the seer, the vision of the prophet. For it was
drawn before the days in which I write, before the Russian
giant had proved his greatness on the body of the Turk, before the
bludgeon-strokes in the Caucasus, the heart-thrust of Erzerum, the
torrent of pursuit of the broken Turks to Mush and Trebizond.</p>

<p>We know—and I am grateful for the chance to voice our gratitude
to him—the greatness of our Russian Ally. We remember the early
days when the Kaiser’s hosts were pouring in over France, and the
Russian thrust into Galicia drew some of the overwhelming weight
from the Western Front. We realise now the nobility of self-sacrifice
that flung an army within reach of the jaws of destruction, that risked
its annihilation to draw upon itself some of the sword-strokes that
threatened to pierce to the heart of the West. Our national and
natural instinct of admiration for a hard fighter, and still greater
admiration for the apex of good sportsmanship, for the friend or foe
who can “take a licking,” who is a “good loser,” went out even more
strongly to Russia in the dark days when, faced by an overwhelming
weight of metal, she was forced and hammered and battered back,
losing battle-line after battle-line, stronghold after stronghold, city
after city; losing everything except heart and dogged punishment-enduring
courage.</p>

<p>And how great the Russian truly is will surely be known presently
to the Turk and to the masquerading false “Prophet of Allah.”</p>

<p>“No one is great save Allah,” says William, and even as the
Turk spoke more truly than he knew in calling the Russian great,
even as he was bitterly to realise the greatness, so in the fullness of
time must William come to realise how great is the Allah of the Moslem,
the Christian God Whom he has blasphemed, and in Whose name he
and his people have perpetrated so many crimes and abominations.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> we consider the public utterances of the German clergy,
we can very easily substitute for their symbol of Christian
faith this malignant, grotesque, and inhuman monster of Louis
Raemaekers. Indeed, our inclination is to thrust the green demon
himself into the pulpit of the Fatherland; for his wrinkled skull could
hatch and his evil mouth utter no more diabolic sentiments than those
recorded and applauded from Lutheran Leipsic, or from the University
and the chief Protestant pulpit in Berlin.</p>

<p>Such sermons are a part of that national <em>debâcle</em> of reasoning faculty
which is the price intellectual Germany has paid for the surrender of
her soul to Prussia.</p>

<p>An example or two may be cited from the outrageous mass.</p>

<p>Professor Rheinhold Seeby, who teaches theology at Berlin University,
has described his nation’s achievements in Belgium and Serbia
as a work of charity, since Germany punishes other States for their good
and out of love. Pastor Philippi, also of Berlin, has said that, as God
allowed His only Son to be crucified, that His scheme of redemption
might be accomplished, so Germany, God with her, must crucify
humanity in order that its ultimate salvation may be secured; and
the Teutonic nation has been chosen to perform this task, because
Germany alone is pure and, therefore, a fitting instrument for the
Divine Hand. Satan, who has returned to earth in the shape of England,
must be utterly destroyed, while the immoral friends and allies of Satan
are called to share his fate. Thus evil will be swept off the earth and
the German Empire henceforth stand supreme protector of the new
kingdom of righteousness. Pastor Zoebel has ordered no compromise
with hell; directed his flock to be pleased at the sufferings of the enemy;
and bade them rejoice when thousands of the non-elect are sent to the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Yes, we will give the green devil his robe and bands until Germany
is in her strait-jacket; after which experience, her conceptions of a
Supreme Being and her own relation thereto may become modified.</p>

and patient faces which we have seen during the last eighteen
months. It is the women, after all—wives, mothers, sisters, and
daughters—who have the heaviest load to bear in war-time.</p>

<p>The courage and heroism which they have shown are an honour to
human nature. The world is richer for it; and the sacrifices which
they have bravely faced and nobly borne may have a greater effect in
convincing mankind of the wickedness and folly of aggressive militarism
than all the eloquence of peace advocates.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the war has made about six German
widows for every one in our country. With these we have no
quarrel; we know that family affection is strong in Germany, and
we are sorry for them. They, like our own suffering women, are
the victims of a barbarous ideal of national glory, and a worse than
barbarous perversion of patriotism, which in our opponents has become
a kind of moral insanity.</p>

<p>These pictures will remain long after the war-passion has subsided.
They will do their part in preventing a recrudescence of it. Who that
has ever clamoured for war can face the unspoken reproach in these
pitiful eyes? Who can think unmoved of the happy romance of wedded
love, so early and so sadly terminated?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> artist spreads before you a view such as you would have on
the great wheat-growing plains of Hungary, or on the level
plateau of Asiatic Turkey—the vast, unending, monotonous, undivided
field of corn. In the background the view is interrupted by
two villages from which great clouds of flame and smoke are rising—they
are both on fire—and as you look closer at the harvest you see
that, instead of wheat, it consists of endless regiments of marching
soldiers.</p>

<p>“The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few”: here is
only one, but he is quite sufficient—“the reaper whose name is Death,”
a skeleton over whose bones the peasant’s dress—a shirt and a pair of
ragged trousers—hangs loose. The shirt-sleeves of the skeleton are
turned well up, as if for more active exertion, as he grasps the two holds
of the huge scythe with which he is sweeping down the harvest.</p>

<p>This is not war of the old type, with its opportunities for chivalry,
its glories, and its pride of manly strength. The German development
of war has made it into a mere exercise in killing, a business of slaughter.
Which side can kill most, and itself outlast the other? When one
reads the calculations by which careful statisticians demonstrate that
in the first seventeen months of the War Germany alone lost over a
million of men killed in battle, one feels that this cartoon is not exaggerated.
It is the bare truth.</p>

<p>The ease with which the giant figure of Death mows down the
harvest of tiny men corresponds, in fact, to the million of German
dead, probably as many among the Russians, to which must be
added the losses among the Austrians, the French, the British, the
Belgians, Italians, Serbs, Turks, and Montenegrins. The appalling
total is this vast harvest which covers the plain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> Yellow Book,” it may be remembered, was the official
publication of some of the details of atrocities committed
by the Huns on the defenceless women and children of
ravished Belgium. It told in cold and unimpassioned sentences, in
plain and simple words more terrible than the most fervid outpourings
of patriot or humanitarian, the tale of brutalities, of cold-blooded crimes,
of murders and rape and mental and physical tortures beyond the
capabilities or the imaginings of savages, possible only in their refinements
of cruelty to the civilised apostles of Kultur. There are
many men in the trenches of the Allies to-day who will say that the
German soldier is a brave man, that he must be brave to advance to
the slaughter of the massed attack, to hold to his trenches under the
horrible punishment of heavy artillery fire.</p>

<p>As a nation we are always ready to admit and to admire physical
courage, and if Germany had fought a “clean fight,” had “played the
game,” starkly and straightly, against our fighting men, we could—and
our fighting men especially could, and I believe would—have helped
her to her feet and shaken hands honestly with her after she was beaten.
But with such a brute beast as the unmasking of the Yellow Book has
revealed Germany to be we can never feel friendship, admiration, or
respect.</p>

<p>The German is a “dirty fighter,” and to the British soldier that
alone puts him beyond the pale. He has outraged all the rules
and the instincts of chivalry. His bravery in battle is the bravery
of a ravening wolf, of a blood-drunk savage animal. It is only left
to the Allies to treat him as such, to thrash him by brute force, and
then to clip his teeth and talons and by treaty and agreement amongst
themselves to keep him chained and caged beyond the possibility of
another outbreak.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the note to another picture I have remarked on the farcical
hypocrisy of the German Emperor in presenting himself, as he
so often does, as the High Priest of several different religions at
the same time. They are nearly all of them religions with which he
would have no sort of concern, even if his religious pose were as real
as it is artificial.</p>

<p>Being in fact the ruler and representative of a country which
alone among European countries builds with complete security upon
the conviction that all Christianity is dead, he can only be, even
in theory, the prince of an extreme Protestant State. Long before
the War it was common for the best caricaturists of Europe, and
even of Germany, to make particular fun of these preposterous temporary
Papacies in which the Kaiser parades himself as if for a fancy-dress
ball; and in the accompanying picture Mr. Raemaekers has
returned more or less to this old pantomimic line of satire.</p>

<p>The cartoon recalls some of those more good-humoured, but perhaps
equally contemptuous, sketches in which the draughtsmen of the French
comic papers used to take a particular delight; which made a whole
comic Bible out of the Kaiser’s adventures during his visit to Palestine.
Here he appears as Moses, and the Red Sea has been dried up to permit
the passage of himself and his people.</p>

<p>It would certainly be very satisfactory for German world-politics
if the sea could be dried up everywhere; but it is unlikely that the
incident will occur, especially in that neighbourhood. It will be long
before a German army is as safe in the Suez Canal as a German Navy
in the Kiel Canal; and the higher critics of Germany will have no
difficulty in proving, in the Kiel Canal at all events, that the safety
is due to human and not to divine wisdom.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cartoon requires no words to tell the story. It holds chapter
upon chapter of tragedy. “I will send you to Germany after
your father!” Where is the boy’s father in Germany? In a prison?
Mending roads? Lying maimed and broken in a rude hospital?
Digging graves for comrades about to be shot? Or, more likely still,
in a rough unknown stranger’s grave? Was the father dragged from
his home at Louvain, or Tirlemont, or Visé, or one of the dozen other
scenes of outrage and murder—a harmless, hard-working citizen—dragged
from his hiding-place and made to suffer “exemplary justice”
for having “opposed the Kaiser’s might,” but in reality because he was
a Belgian, for whose nasty breed there must be demonstrations of
Germany’s frightfulness <i lang="fr">pour encourager les autres</i>?</p>

<p>And the child’s mother and sisters—what of them? He is dejected,
but not broken. There is dignity in the boy’s defiant pose. The scene
has, perhaps, been enacted hundreds of times in the cities of Belgium,
where poignant grief has come to a nation which dared to be itself.</p>

<p>Follow this boy through life and observe the stamp of deep resolve
on his character. Though he be sent “to Germany after your father,”
though he be for a generation under the German jack-boot, his spirit
will sustain him against the conqueror and will triumph in the end.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> wonder is not that women went mad, but that there are left
any sane civilians of the ravished districts of Belgium after
all those infamies perpetrated under orders by the German troops
after the first infuriating check of Liége and before the final turning
of the German line at the battle of the Marne. We have supped full
of horrors since, and by an insensible process grown something callous.
But we never came near to realising the Belgian agony, and Raemaekers
does us service by helping to make us see it mirrored in the eyes of
this poor raving girl. This indeed is a later incident, but will serve
for reminder of the earlier worse.</p>

<p>It is really <em>not</em> well to forget. These were not the inevitable horrors
of war, but a deliberately calculated effect. There seems no hope of
the future of European civilisation till the men responsible for such
things are brought to realise that, to put it crudely and at its lowest,
they don’t pay.</p>

<p>What the attitude of Germany now is may be guessed from the
blank refusal even of her bishops to sanction the investigation which
Cardinal Mercier asks for. It is still the gentle wolf’s theory that the
truculent lamb was entirely to blame.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> were few things that Junkerdom feared so much in
modern Germany as the growth and effects of Socialism; and
it is certain that the possible attitude of the German Socialists—who
were thought by some writers to number somewhere in the neighbourhood
of two million—in regard to the War at its outset greatly
exercised the minds of Junkerdom and the Chancellor. A few days
after the declaration of War a well-known English Socialist said to us,
“I believe that the Socialists will be strong enough greatly to handicap
Germany in the carrying on of the War, and possibly, if she meets
with reverses in the early stages, to bring about Peace before Christmas.”</p>

<p>That was in August, 1914, and we are now well on in the Spring of 1916.
We reminded the speaker that on a previous occasion, when Peace
still hung in the balance, he had declared with equal conviction that
there would be no War because “the Socialists are now too strong in
Germany not to exercise a preponderating restraining influence.”
He has proved wrong in both opinions. And one can well imagine
that the Junker class admires Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg for the
astute manner in which he has succeeded in shepherding the German
Socialist sheep for the slaughter, and in muzzling their representatives
in the Reichstag.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is something daunting, even to the mind of one not
guilty of war or of massacres, in the thought of multitudes:
the multitude of the dead, of the living, of one generation, of men since
there have been men on earth. And war brings this horror to us daily,
or rather nightly, because such great companies of men have suddenly
died together, passing in comradeship and community from the known
to the unknown. Yet dare we say “together”? The unparalleled
solitariness and singleness of death is not altered by the general and
simultaneous doom of battle.</p>

<p>And it is with the multitude, and all the <em>ones</em> in it, that the maker
of war is in unconscious relation. He does not know their names,
he does not know them by any kind of distinction, he knows them
only by thousands. Yet everyone with a separate life and separate
death is in conscious relation with <em>him</em>, knows him for the tyrant who
has taken his youth, his hope, his love, his fatherhood.</p>

<p>What a multitude to meet, whether in thought, in conscience, or in
another world! We all, no doubt, try to make the thought of massacre
less intolerable to our minds by telling ourselves that the sufferers suffer
one by one, to each his own share, and not another’s; that though
the numbers may appal, they do not make each man’s part more
terrible. But this is not much comfort. There is not, it is true, a
sum of multiplication; but there is the sum of addition. And that
addition—the multitude man by man—the War Lord has to reckon
with: Frederick the Great with his men, Napoleon with his, the
German Emperor with his—each one of the innumerable unknown
knowing his destroyer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Committee of Enquiry, like another Portia, clothed in the
ermine-trimmed robe of Justice and the Law, has unlocked with
the key of Truth the door of the closed chamber. The key lies behind
her inscribed in Dutch with the name that tells its nature. The Committee
then pulls back the curtain, and reveals the horrors that are
behind it. Before the curtain is fully drawn back, Enquiry sinks
almost in collapse at the terrible sight that is disclosed. There hang
to pegs on the wall the bodies of Bluebeard’s victims, a woman, an old
man, a priest, two boys, and a girl still half hidden behind the curtain.
The blood that has trickled from them coagulates in pools on the ground.</p>

<p>Bluebeard himself comes suddenly: he hurries down the steps
brandishing his curved sword, a big, burly figure, with square, thick
beard, and streaming whiskers, wearing a Prussian helmet, his mouth
open to utter a roar of rage and fury. The hatred and scorn with which
the artist inspires his pictures of Prussia are inexhaustible in their
variety: Prussia is barbarism attempting to trample on law and
education, brutality beating down humanity, a grim figure, the incarnation
of “frightfulness.” I can imagine the feelings with which
all Germans must regard the picture that the Dutch artist always gives
of their country, if they regard Prussia as their country. “For every
cartoon of Raemaekers,” said a German newspaper, “the payment
will be exacted in full, when the reckoning is made up.” To this
painter the Prussian ruling power is incapable of understanding what
nobility of nature means. He can practise on and take advantage of
the vices and weaknesses of his enemies; he can buy the services of
many among them, and have all the worser people in his fee as his
servants and agents; but he is always foiled, because he forgets that
some men cannot be bought, and that these men will steel their fellow-countrymen’s
minds to resist tyranny to the last. The mass of men
can be led either to evil or to good.</p>

<p>The Prussian military system assumes the former as certain, and is
well skilled in the way. But there is the latter way, too, which Prussia
never knew and never takes into account as a possibility; and men as
a whole prefer the way to good before the way to evil, when both are
fully explained and made clear. This saves men, and ruins Prussia.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> seaman of history is a chivalrous and romantic figure, a
gallant and relentless fighter, a generous and a tender conqueror.
In Codrington’s first letter to his wife after the battle of Trafalgar, he
tells her to send £100 to one of the French captains who goes to England
from the battle as a prisoner of war. The British and French navies
cherish a hundred memories of acts like these. If the German navy
survives the war what memories will it have? It must search the
gaols for the exemplars in peace of the acts that win them the Iron
Cross in war.</p>

<p>Note in this drawing that the types selected are not in themselves
base units of humanity. They have been made so by the beastly
crimes superior orders have forced them to commit. But even this
has not brought them so low but they wonder at the topsy-turvydom
of war that brings them honour where poor Black Mary only got her
deserts in gaol.</p>

<p>The crimes of the higher command have passed in Germany uncondemned
and unbanned by cardinals and bishops. But the conscience
of Germany cannot be wholly dead. Nor will six years only be the
term of Germany’s humiliation and remorse. The spotless white of
the naval uniform, sullied and besmirched by those savage cruelties,
cannot, any more than the German soul, be brought back “whiter
than snow” by any bestowal of the Iron Cross. The effort to cleanse
either would “the multitudinous seas incarnadine.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Here</span> is the grim choice of alternatives presented to other nations
by the creed of <i lang="de">Deutschland über Alles</i>—the cost of resistance
and the reward of submission. On one side lies the man who has
fought a good fight “for Freedom.” He has lost his life but won an
immortal memory inscribed upon the cross. The other has saved his
life, and lo! it is a “dog’s life.” He is not even a well-treated dog.
Harnessed, muzzled, chained, he crawls abjectly on hands and knees
and drags painfully along the road, not only the cart, but his heavy
master too.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands and other parts of the Continent, where
dogs are used to pull little carts, the owner generally pulls too; it
is a partnership in which the dog is treated as a friend and visibly
enjoys doing his share. Partnership with Germany is another matter.
The dog does all the work, the German takes his ease with his great
feet planted on the submissive creature’s back.</p>

<p>The belligerent nations have made their choice. Germany’s partners
have chosen submission and are playing the dog’s part, as they have
discovered. The Allies on the other side are paying the price of resistance
in the sacrifice of life for Freedom. And what of the neutrals?
They are evading the choice under cover of the Allies and waxing fat
meanwhile. It is not a very heroic attitude and will exclude them
from any voice in the settlement. But we understand their position,
and at least they are ready to fight for their own freedom. There are,
however, individuals who are not ready to fight at all. They call
themselves conscientious objectors, prate of the law of Christ and pose
as idealists. If they followed Christ they would sacrifice their lives
for others, but they are only concerned for their own skins. Their
place is in the shafts. The true idealist lies beneath the Cross.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Most</span> people have wondered from time to time what the Kaiser
thinks in his inmost heart and in the solitude of his own chamber
about the condition of Germany and about the War. What impression
has been made on him by the alternation of victories and failures during
the last twenty months? After all he has staked everything—he has
everything to lose. What does he feel? What impression do the
frightful losses of his own people make on him?</p>

<p>Raemaekers tells in this cartoon. The Kaiser has this moment
been wakened from sleep by the entrance of a big gorgeously dressed
footman, carrying his morning tea. The panelling of the royal chamber
in the palace at Potsdam is faintly indicated. The Kaiser sits up in
bed, and a look of agony gathers on his face as he realises that he has
wakened up to the grim horror of a new day, and that the delightful
time which he has just been living through was only a dream. He had
dreamed that the whole thing was not true—that the War had never
really occurred, and that he could face the world with a conscience
clear from guilt; and now he has wakened up to bear the burden for
another day. It is written in his face what he thinks. You see the
deep down-drawn lines in the lower part of the face, the furrows upon
the forehead, and the look almost of terror in the eyes. But a smug-faced
flunkey offers him a cup of tea with buttered toast, and he must
come back to the pretence of that tragi-comedy, the life of the King-Emperor.</p>

<p>The Dutch artist is fully alive to the comic element which underlies
that tragedy. The King-Emperor, as he awakes from sleep and sits
forward from that mountain of pillows, would be a purely comic figure
were it not for the terrible tragedy written in his face. A footman in
brilliant livery is a comic figure. The splendour of this livery brings
out the comic element by its contrast to, and yet its harmony with,
the stupid self-satisfaction of the countenance and the curls of the
powdered hair.</p>

<p>The Kaiser, however, awakens to more than the pretences and shams
of court life. The vast dreams which he cherished before the War of
world-conquest and an invincible Germany are fled now, and he must
face, open-eyed and awake, the stern reality.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Dutchman who could see this cartoon and not admit its
simple truth would have to be a very blind pro-German. At
the present time it pays Germany to pretend a friendship for Holland,
but the premeditated murder of Belgium is a plain object-lesson of the
sort of friendship and agreement that Germany makes with a country
and people which stand in her way and are too small to withstand
her brute force. Can any Dutchman doubt what would be
Holland’s fate if Germany emerged even moderately victorious from
this war? The German War Staff would give a good deal to have the
control of Holland and a free passage to the sea from Antwerp. They
refrain from using force to gain that control only because they cannot
afford to have a fresh frontier to guard and because it is quite useful
to have Holland neutral and a forbidden ground and water to the
Armies and Navies of the Allies, a shield over the heart of Berlin and
Germany. It would pay the Germans to have Holland with them
and openly against the Allies, and they would no doubt gladly make an
“agreement” to that effect; but there is little likelihood of that as
long as the Dutch can visualise the “agreement” as clearly as the
cartoonist has done here.</p>

<p>There are many people who for years past have suspected Germany’s
sinister designs on the whole of the Netherlands. The brutal ravaging
of Belgium, the talk that already runs, openly or in whispers, in Germany
of “annexation of conquered territories” and “extended borders,”
tell plainly the same tale—that any agreement between a small country
and Germany means merely the swallowing-up of the small nation,
the “agreement” of a meal with the swallower-up.</p>

<p>“There is only one master in this country,” the Kaiser has said of
Germany. “I am he, and I will not tolerate another.” He has also
told his people: “There is only one law—my law; the law which I
myself lay down.” It is supererogatory to dispute either of these
imperial pronouncements. The Future contents herself with the
comment: “Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee.”</p>

<p>The Kaiser and his counsellors have now translated words into
deeds, and every instrument of savagery has been since August, 1914,
enlisted by Tyranny in the attempt to overthrow Liberty. “A thousand
years ago,” the Kaiser once declared to his Army, “the Huns under
their king Attila made themselves a name which still lives in tradition.”
The Future replies to him that he and his fighting hordes will also live
in tradition. They will be remembered for their defiance of the conscience
of the world, which obeys no call but that of Liberty.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">You</span> cannot well conceive a science, whether it be mathematics,
or architecture, or philosophy, without its axioms, dogmas, or
first principles. Without them there is no basis on which to raise the
superstructure. So it is with the science of religion. Take Christianity:
if it is to be taught scientifically, it must start with the most tremendous
dogma, the Divinity of Christ. Either Christ was or He was not what
He claimed to be. If He was not, you must shout with the Sanhedrim:
“Crucify Him!” If He was, you must sing with the Church: “Come,
adore Him.” One thing is certain, you cannot be indifferent to His
claim or to Him; you must either hate Him and His creed, like the
Prussian warring Superman, or love Him and it, like England’s Crusading
Kings.</p>

<p>The cartoon before us is the finished picture which I can trace from
its first rough sketch in the hands of Kant, through its different stages
of development in the schools of Hegel, of Schopenhauer, of Strauss,
till it was ready for its final touches in the hands of Nietzsche. In
fancy I see it hung, on the line, in the Prussian picture-gallery under
the direction of War Lords, whose boasted aim it is that the world shall
be governed only by Prussian Kultur and Prussian Religion.</p>

<p>The fatal mistake made by the Teutonic race in the past was, we are
told, the adoption of Roman culture and Roman religion. Germany
once submitted to an alien God and to an alien creed. She, the mistress
of the earth, the mightiest of the mighty, and the most Kultured of the
Kultured, had actually once worshipped “an uncultured peasant Galilean,”
and made profession of “His slave morality.”</p>

<p>Now they had altogether done with Christ, the Nazarene. The
shout had gone forth: “We will not have this Man to rule over us.”
In the future no gods but Thor and Odin shall rule the “world-dominating
race.” Prussia seemed to think the world’s need to-day
was the religion, not of Virtue, but of Valour. “In a day now long fled
was heard the cry: ‘Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth,’ but to-day there shall go forth the word: ‘Blessed are the
valiant, for they shall make the earth their throne.’ In the past ye
heard it said: ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,’ but now I say to you:
‘Blessed are the great in soul, for they shall enter into Valhalla.’
Again, in the dark ages it was said to you: ‘Blessed are the peace-makers,’
but now in the blaze of day I say unto you: ‘Blessed are the
war-makers, for they shall be called, if not the children of Jahve, the
children of Odin, who is greater than Jahve.’” For those who want
more of this mad jargon on the same lines let me refer them to the late
Professor Cramb’s book on Germany and England.</p>

<p>With this cartoon before me, I am driven to fear that when the war is
done there will rise up in Germany a louder and stronger cry against the
Christianity of Christ than ever was attempted after the Franco-Prussian
War. The “man of blood and iron,” the man with the mailed
fist and the iron heel, I much apprehend, will not be satisfied with
tearing down the emblem of the physical Body of Christ, but to slake his
bloodthirsty spirit he will want to go on to belabour His Mystical Body
no less. God avert it!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this war, where the ranks of the enemy present to us so many
formidable, sinister, and shocking figures, there is one, and perhaps
but one, which is purely ridiculous. If we had the heart to relieve our
strained feelings by laughter, it would be at the gross Coburg traitor,
with his bodyguard of assassins and his hidden coat-of-mail, his shaking
hands and his painted face. The world has never seen a meaner
scoundrel, and we may almost bring ourselves to pity the Kaiser,
whom circumstances have forced to accept on equal terms a potentate
so verminous.</p>

<p>But we no longer smile, we are tempted rather to weep, when
we think of the nation over whom this Ferdinand exercises his
disastrous authority. Forty years will have expired this spring since
the Christian peasants of Bulgaria rose in arms against the Turkish
oppressor. After a year of wild mountain fighting, Russia, with fraternal
devotion, came to their help, and at San Stefano in March, 1877, the
aspirations of Bulgaria were satisfied under Russia auspices. Ten years
later Ferdinand the usurper descended upon Sofia, shielded by the
protection of Austria, and since then, under his poisonous rule, the honour
and spirit of the once passionate and romantic Bulgarian nation have
faded like a plant in poison-fumes.</p>

<p>Raemaekers presents the odious Ferdinand to us in the act of
starting for the wars—he who faints at the sight of a drawn sword.
His hired assassins guard him from his own people and from the
revenge of the thousands whom he has injured. But will they always
be able to secure so vile a life against the vengeance of history? How
soon will Fate condescend to crush this painted creature?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> Loan: good for 100 marks!” Look at him! He is the
favoured of the Earth, lives in Germany, where Kultur is peerless,
and education complete (even tho’ the man may become a martyr
of method). War comes! and he is seen, as an almond tree in blossom
his years tell, when lo! a War Loan is raised with real Helfferichian
candour, and Michael has just stepped out of the Darlehnskasse, at
Oberwesel-on-the-Rhine, or other seat of Kultur and War Loan finance.
Are visions about? said an American humorist now gone to the
Shades; and Michael, Loan note in hand, eyes reversed, after a visit
to two or three offices, wants to know, and wonders whether this note
can be regarded as “hab und gut,” and if so, good for how much?
Is it a wonder that an artist in a Neutral Country should depict German
affairs as in this condition, and business done in this manner? Michael
is puzzled; and in the language of the Old Kent Road, “’e dunno
where ’e are!” He is puzzled, and not without cause.</p>

<p>All who have followed Germany’s financing of the War share Michael’s
perplexity. Brag is a good dog: but it does not do as a foundation for
credit. Gold at Spandau was trumpeted for years as a “war chest”;
but when the “best laid schemes o’ mice and men gang aft agley,”
especially when a war does not end, as it should, after a jolly march to
Paris in six weeks, through a violated and plundered Belgium, then
comes the rub—and the paper which puzzles Michael. A German,
possibly Dr. Helfferich, the German Finance Minister, may believe,
and some do believe, that it does not matter how much “paper,” in
currency notes, a State, or even a Bank, may issue. The more experienced
commercial and banking concerns of the world insist upon a
visible material, as well as the personal security, to which the German
is prone. The round-about method of issuing German War Loans unquestionably
puzzles Michael; but will not impose on the world outside.</p>

<p>Let it be marked also, that German credit methods have been,
in part, the proximate cause of this War; a system of credit-trading
may last for some years only to threaten disaster and general
ruin. Now, it is “neck or nothing”; Michael goes the round of the
Loan offices, and behold him! Germany herself fears a crash in
credit, and even the German Michael feels that it is impending. Already
the mark exchanges over 30 below par.</p>

<p>Death, with the grin on his fleshless face, is hurrying them
along to it as fast as his troika can go. Three black horses abreast he
drives—Dishonour, Disappointment, and Disgrace—and the more
audacious of the carrion-crows fly croaking ominously alongside.</p>

<p>Little Willie, with the insignia of his family’s doom on his head, is
not happy in his mind. “Father’s” plans have not worked smoothly,
his promises have not been fulfilled. Little Willie is concerned for his
own future. He is the only sold in the world who is.</p>

<p>When the First—the real—Napoleon entered Russia, on June 24th,
1812, he led an army of 414,000 men—the grande armée. When the
great retreat began from burnt-out Moscow he had less than 100,000.
By the time the Beresina was reached but little of the grand army was
left. “Of the cavalry reserve, formerly 32,000 men, only 100 answered
the muster-roll.” The passage of the river, which was to interpose
its barrier between him and the pursuing Russians, was an inferno of
panic, selfishness, and utter demoralisation. Finally, to secure his
own safety, Napoleon had the bridges burnt before half his men had
crossed. The roll-call that night totalled 8,000 gaunt spectres, hardly
to be called men.</p>

<p>“<em>Father, is it still a long way to the Beresina?</em>”</p>

<p>We may surely and rightly put up that question as a prayer to the
God whom Kaiser William claims as friend, but whom he has flouted
and bruised as never mortal man since time began has bruised and
flouted friend before.</p>

<p>“<em>Is it still a long way to the Beresina?</em>”</p>

<p>God grant them a short quick course, an end for ever to militarism,
to the wastage it has entailed, and to all those evils which have made
such things possible in this year of grace 1916.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> present policy of Germany is a curious mixture of underhand
diplomacy and boastful threats. If she desires to impress the
neutral States, she vaunts the great conquests that she has been able to
accomplish. She points out, especially to Roumania and to Greece,
how terrible is her vengeance on States which defy her, such as Belgium
and Serbia, while vague promises are given to her Near-Eastern Allies—Bulgaria
and Turkey—that they will have large additions to their
territory as a reward for compliance with the dictates of Berlin.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, it is very clear that, as part and parcel of this
vigorous offensive, Germany is already in more quarters than one suggesting
that she is quite open to offers of peace. As everyone knows,
von Bülow in Switzerland is the head and controlling agent of a great
movement in the direction of peace; while lately we have heard of
offers made to Belgium that if she will acknowledge a commercial
dependence on the Central Empires her territory will be restored to
her. Similar movements are going on in America, because throughout
Germany still seeks to pose as a nation which was attacked and had
to defend herself, and is therefore quite ready to listen if any reasonable
offers come from her enemies to bring the war to a close.</p>

<p>The unhappy German Imperial Chancellor has to play his part in this
sorry comedy with such skill as he can manage. To his German countrymen
he has to proclaim that the war has been one brilliant progress from
the start to the present time. This must be done in order to allay the
apprehensions of Berlin and to propitiate the ever-increasing demand
for more plentiful supplies of food. Secretly he has to work quite
as hard to secure for the Central Empires such a conclusion of
hostilities as will leave them masters of Europe. And, without doubt,
he has to put up with a good many indignities in the process. “The
worst of it is, I must always deny having been there.” Kicked out by
the Allies, he has to pretend that no advances were ever made. Perhaps,
however, such a task is not uncongenial to the man who began by
asserting that solemnly ratified treaties were only “scraps of paper.”</p>

when an armed man shelters himself behind the unarmed; yet
it is not the climax, for here the artist depicts a body of German troops
sheltering themselves behind women, calculating that the Belgians
will not fire on their own countrywomen and unarmed friends, and
that so the attack may safely gain an advantage.</p>

<p>There is a studied contrast between the calm, orderly march of the
troops with shouldered arms and the huddled, disorderly progress to
which the townspeople are compelled. These are not marching: they
are going to their death. Several of the women have their hands raised
in frantic anguish, their eyes are like the eyes of insanity, and one at
least has her mouth opened to emit a shriek of terror. Two of the men
are in even worse condition; they are collapsing, one forward, one
backward, with outstretched hands as if grasping at help. The rest
march on, courageously or stolidly. Some seem hardly to understand,
some understand and accept their fate with calm resignation.</p>

<p>One old woman walks quietly with bowed head submissive. In
the front walks a priest, his hand raised in the gesture of blessing his
flock. The heroism of the Catholic priesthood both in France and in
Belgium forms one of the most honourable features of the Great War,
and stands in striking contrast with the calculating diplomatic policy
of the Papacy. There is always the same tendency in the “chief
priests” of every race and period to be tempted to sacrifice moral
considerations to expediency, and to prefer the empty fabric of an
imposing Church establishment to the people who make the Church.
But the clergy of Belgium are there to prove what the Church can do
for mankind. This cartoon would be incomplete and would deserve
condemnation as inartistic if it were not redeemed by the priest and
the old woman.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> venerable quip that what is firmness in ourselves is obstinacy
in our opponents is illustrated with a ludicrous explicitness in
the whole tenor of German official utterance since the failure of the
great drives. The obtuseness of the Allies is so abysmal (it is again
and again complained in the Reichstag and through Wolff) that they
are unable to see that Germany is the permanently triumphant victor.
Whereas for Germany, whose cause even the neutrals judge to be lost,
to hold out at the cost of untold blood and treasure is merely the manifestation
of heaven-conferred German steadfastness. The Army into
whose obstinate corporate head it is hardest to drive the idea of German
military all-powerfulness is the Russian, of which retreating units,
actually armed with staves against a superbly equipped (but innocent
and wantonly attacked) foe, were so stupid as to forget how to be broken
and demoralised.</p>

bobs up serenely in another and most inconvenient place. Absurd;

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> cartoon is horribly suggestive of Hun utilitarian methods!
I am told by an eminent chemist that six pounds of glycerine can
be extracted from the corpse of a fairly well nourished Hun, and I can
well believe that such an opportunity for replenishing the diminishing
stocks of a much needed commodity is not neglected by the Great General
Staff.</p>

<p><em>Bundles of Four!</em></p>

<p>And why not, from the Hun point of view?</p>

<p>They have scrapped sentiment, together with humanity. What is
<em>gun-fodder</em> to the Scourge of God? These unfortunates, when alive,
were driven ruthlessly to inevitable slaughter. They are sent as
ruthlessly to the blast furnaces. One million dead men are resolved
into six million pounds of glycerine. Thus the Happy Fatherland is
served.</p>

<p>One wonders whether the statisticians of the Central Powers have yet
computed what a million of dead Huns represents in cash. A soldier
capable of serving his country in the field must be worth at least fifty
pounds sterling per annum to that country. Let us say that each dead
man represents a capitalisation of one thousand pounds. We have
then, roughly, a loss of one thousand million pounds, leaving out the
totally and partially disabled.</p>

<p>What a handicap when they begin, after the war, the economic
struggle for supremacy!</p>

<p>Time was when the enemy losses sent a shiver down our spinal
columns. That time—thanks to Hun methods—has passed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Turkey</span> had no illusions from the beginning on the subject of
the war. If the choice had been left to the nation she would not
have become Germany’s catspaw. Unfortunately for Turkey, she has
had no choice. For years upon years the Sultan Abdul Hamid was
Turkey. Opposition to his will meant death for his opponent. Thus
Turkey became inarticulate. Her voice was struck dumb. The revolution
was looked upon hopefully as the dawn of a new era. Abdul
Hamid was dethroned; his brother, a puppet, was exalted, anointed,
and enthroned. Power passed from the Crown, not, as expected, to
the people and its representatives, but into the hands of a youthful
adventurer, in German pay, who has led his country from one folly to
another.</p>

<p>Turkey did not want to fight, but she had no choice, and so
she was dragged in by the heels. She has lost much beside her independence.
The crafty German has drained her of supplies while
giving naught in return. The German’s policy is to strive throughout
for a weak Turkey. The weaker Turkey can be made, the better will it
be for Germany, which hopes still, no matter what may happen elsewhere,
so to manipulate things as to dominate the Ottoman Empire
after the war.</p>

<p>Turkey is still a rich country, in spite of her enormous sacrifices
in the past decade. She has been exploited from end to end
by the German adventurer, who will continue the process of bleeding
so long as there is safety in the method; but Turkey is beginning to
ask herself, as does the figure of the fat Pasha in the cartoon: “And is
this all the compensation I get?” An Iron Cross does not pay for the
loss of half a million good soldiers. Yet that is the exact measure of
Turkey’s reward.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> what are we most like our kinsmen the Germans, and in what
most unlike? I was convicted of Teutonism when first, in Germany,
I ate “brod und butter,” and found the words pronounced in an English
way, slurred. But if we are like the Germans in the names of simple
and childish things, we grow more unlike them, we draw farther apart
from them, as we grow up. We love war less and less, as they love it
more. We love our word of honour more and more as they, for the
love of war, love their word less.</p>

<p>There is no nation in the world more unlike us; because there is no
war so perfect, so conscious, so complete as the German. And being
thus all-predominant, German war is the greatest of outrages on life
and death. We English have a singular degree of respect for the
dead. It has no doubt expressed itself in some slight follies and
vulgarities, such as certain funeral customs, not long gone by; but
such respect is a national virtue and emotion. No nation loving
war harbours that virtue. And in nothing do the kinsmen with
whom we have much language in common differ from us more than
in the policy that brought this Prussian host to cumber the stagnant
waters of the Marshes of Pinsk.</p>

<p>The love of war has cast them there, displayed, profaned, in the
“cold obstruction” of their dissolution. Corruption is not sensible
corruption when it is a secret in earth where no eye, no hand,
no breathing can be aware of it. There is no offence in the
grave. But the lover of war, the Power that loved war so much
as to break its oath for the love of war, and for the love of war to strike
aside the hand of the peace-maker, Arbitration, that Power has chosen
thus to expose and to betray the multitude of the dead.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Three</span> <em>apaches</em> sit crouched in shelter waiting the moment to
strike. One is old and <em>gaga,</em> his ancient fingers splayed on the
ground to support him and his face puckered with the petulance of
age. One is a soft shapeless figure—clearly with small heart for the
business, for he squats there as limp as a sack. One is the true stage
conspirator with a long pendulous nose and narrow eyes. His knife
is in his teeth, and he would clearly like to keep it there, for he has
no stomach for a fight. He will only strike if he can get in a secret
blow. The leader of the gang has the furtive air of the criminal,
his chin sunk on his breast, and his cap slouched over his brows. His
right hand holds a stiletto, his pockets bulge with weapons or plunder,
his left hand is raised with the air of a priest encouraging his flock.
And his words are the words of religion—“God with us.” At the
sign the motley crew will get to work.</p>

<p>It is wholesome to strip the wrappings from grandiose things. Public
crimes are no less crimes because they are committed to the sound
of trumpets, and the chicanery of crowned intriguers is morally the
same as the tricks of hedge bandits. It is the privilege of genius to get
down to fundamentals. Behind the stately speech of international
<i lang="fr">pourparlers</i> and the rhetoric of national appeals burn the old lust and
greed and rapine. A stab in the dark is still a stab in the dark though
courts and councils are the miscreants. A war of aggression is not less
brigandage because the armies march to proud songs and summon
the Almighty to their aid.</p>

<p>Raemaekers has done much to clear the eyes of humanity. The
monarch of <i>Felix Austria</i>, with the mantle of the Holy Roman Empire
still dragging from his shoulders, is no more than a puzzled, broken
old man, crowded in this bad business beside the Grand Turk, against
whom his fathers defended Europe. The preposterous Ferdinand,
shorn of his bombast, is only a chicken-hearted assassin. The leader
of the band, the All Highest himself, when stripped of his white cloak
and silver helmet, shows the slouch and the furtive ferocity of the street-corner
bravo. And the cry “God with us,” which once rallied Crusades,
has become on such lips the signal of the <em>apache</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is one whole field of the evil international influence of
Germany in which Ferdinand of Bulgaria is a much more important
and symbolic person than William of Prussia. He is, of course,
a cynical cosmopolitan. He is in great part a Jew, and an advanced
type of that <i lang="fr">mauvais juif</i> who is the principal obstacle to all the attempts
of the more genuine and honest Jews to erect a rational status for their
people.</p>

<p>Like almost every man of this type, he is a Jingo without being
a patriot. That is to say, he is of the type that believes in big
armaments and in a diplomacy even more brutal than armaments;
but the militarism and diplomacy are not humanised either by the
ancient national sanctities which surround the Czar of Russia, or the
spontaneous national popularity which established the King of Serbia.
He is not national, but international; and even in his peaceful activities
has been not so much a neutral as a spy.</p>

<p>In the accompanying cartoon the Dutch caricaturist has thrust with
his pencil at the central point of this falsity. It is something which
is probably the central point of everything everywhere, but is especially
the central point of everything connected with the deep quarrels of
Eastern Europe. It is religion. Russian Orthodoxy is an enormously
genuine thing; Austrian Romanism is a genuine thing; Islam is a
genuine thing; Israel, for that matter, is also a genuine thing.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand of Bulgaria is not a genuine thing; and he represents
the whole part played by Prussia in these ancient disputes. That
part is the very reverse of genuine; it is a piece of ludicrous and
transparent humbug. If Prussia had any religion, it would be a
northern perversion of Protestantism utterly distant from and indifferent
to the controversies of Slavonic Catholics. But Prussia has
no religion. For her there is no God; and Ferdinand is his prophet.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Latin Sisters! Note carefully the expression of France as
contrasted with that of Italy. France, violated by the Hun,
exhibits grim determination made sacrosanct by suffering. Italy’s
face glows with enthusiasm. One can conceive of the one fighting
on to avenge her martyrs, steadfast to the inevitable end when Right
triumphs over Might. One can conceive of the other drawing her
sword because of the blood tie which links them together in a bond that
craft and specious lies have tried in vain to sunder. What do they
stand for, these two noble sisters? Everything which can be included
in the word—ART. Everything which has built up, stone upon stone,
the stately temple of Civilisation, everything which has served to
humanise mankind and to differentiate him from the beasts of Prussia.</p>

<p>Looking at these two sisters, one wonders that there are still to be
found in England mothers who allow their children to be taught German.
One hazards the conjecture that it might well be imparted to exceptionally
wicked children, if there be any, because none can question that the
Teutonic tongue will be spoken almost exclusively in the nethermost
deeps of Hades until, and probably after, the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>For my sins I studied German in Germany, and I rejoice to think
that I have forgotten nearly every word of that raucous and obscene
language. Had I a child to educate, and the choice between German
and Choctaw were forced upon me, I should not select German. French,
Italian and Spanish, cognate tongues, easy to learn, delightful to speak,
hold out sweet allurements to English children. Do not these suffice?
If any mother who happens to read these lines is considering the propriety
of teaching German to a daughter, let her weigh well the responsibility
which she is deliberately assuming. To master any foreign
language, it is necessary to talk much and often with the natives. Do
Englishwomen wish to talk with any Huns after this war? What will
be the feelings of an English mother whose daughter marries a Hun
any time within the next twenty years? And such a mother will
know that she planted the seed which ripened into catastrophe when
she permitted her child to acquire the language of our detestable and
detested enemies.</p>

the day. But on the morrow of the day, when questions of responsibility
came to be raised, he became one of many inconvenient witnesses; and
there has scarcely been a better joke among the grim humours of this
catastrophe than the mission of this Redhot-Gospeller of the New
Unchivalry of War to explain to “those idiotic Yankees” that he was
really an ardent pacifist. The most just, the most brilliant, the most
bitter pamphlet of invective could surely not say so much as this
reeking cleaver, those bloody hands, that fatuous leer and gesture, this
rigid victim. Bernhardism was not a mere windy theory. It was

the rule of France or as many Indians have come to prefer the rule

<p>A wise policy would have dictated such a careful respect for private

those who had violated their national independence. But Prussia is
incapable of such a policy. In any territory which she occupies, whether

of movement—without soul or inspiration. He himself is thin and
scraggy—Raemaekers has intensified these characteristics, but even so
the caricature of the reality is more accurate than unkind. Many
months ago, this vacuous heir of the house of Hohenzollern set
to work on the task of overcoming France, and the result ... may be
found in bundles of four, going back to the incinerators beyond Aix,
in the piled corpses before the French positions at and about Verdun;
some of the results, the swag of the decadent burglar, went back in sacks
from the châteaux that this despicable thing polluted and robbed as
might any Sikes from Portland or Pentonville.</p>

<p>He is the embodiment, himself, of the last phase of Prussian kultur.
Somewhere back in the history of Prussia its rulers had to invent and
to create, and then kultur brought forth hard men; later, it became
possible to copy, and then kultur brought forth mechanical perfection
rather than creative perfection, systematised its theories of life and
work, and brought into being a class of men just a little meaner, more
rigid, more automaton-like, than the original class; having reduced
life to one system, and that without soul or ideal, kultur brought forth
types lacking more and more in originality. Here stands the culminating
type; he will copy the good German Gott—he is incapable of
originating anything—and will “do the same to France.”</p>

<p>As far as lies in his power, he has done it; in the day of reckoning,
Germany will judge how he has done it, and it is to be hoped that
Germany will give him his just reward, for no punishment could be more
fitting. The rest of the world already knows his vacuity, his utter
uselessness, his criminal decadence. As his father was stripped of the

gone. Her navy is dishonoured. Some force she still possesses at sea,
but it is force to be expended on sea piracy alone. And it is not piracy
that can save her. At most, in her extremity, it will do for her what a
life belt does for a lone figure in a deserted ocean. It prolongs the
agony that precedes inevitable extinction. It is the throw of the
desperate gambler that Germany has made, when she flings this last
vestige of her honour into the sea.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">While</span> a world of mourners is plaintively asking, “What has
become of our brave dead, where are they? Alas! how dark
is the world without them, how silent the home, how sad the heart”;
whilst the mourner is groping like the blind woman for her lost treasure,
the Belgian mother, and the Belgian widow, and the Belgian orphan
are on their knees, praying, “Eternal rest give to them, O Lord;
let a perpetual light shine upon them,” the Christian plea that
has echoed down the ages from the day of the Maccabees till now,
exhorting us to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from
their sins.</p>

<p>I would remind the broken-hearted mother beseeching me to tell her
where can her brave boy be gone, adding, “His was such a lonely
journey; did he find his way to God?” of the words of the poet,
who finds his answer to her question in the flight of a sea bird sailing
sunward from the winter snows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a Power whose care</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teaches thy way along the pathless coast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The desert and illimitable air,</div>

<p>The brave soldier, who in the discharge of high duty has been suddenly
shot into eternity by the fire of the enemy, will surely, far more easily
than the migrating bird, wing his flight to God, Who, let us pray, will
not long withhold him the happy-making vision of Heaven. Pilgrims
homeward-bound, as you readily understand, at different stages of
their journey will picture Heaven to themselves differently, according
as light or darkness, joy or sorrow encompass them. Some will picture
Heaven as the Everlasting Holiday after the drudgery of school life,
others as Eternal Happiness after a life of suffering and sorrow, others
again as Home after exile, and some others as never-ending Rapture
in the sight of God.</p>

<p>But to-day, when “frightfulness” is the creed of the enemy, and
warfare with atrocities is his gospel, very many amongst us, weary
with the long-drawn battle, sick with its ever-recurring horrors, and
broken by its ghastly revelations, will lift up their eyes to a land beyond
the stars.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> may be asserted that the plea of “Frightfulness” will not be
recognised a “military necessity” when Germany is judged, and
that this enemy of civilisation, even as the enemy of society, will be
held responsible for its crimes, though they stand as far above the
imagination as beyond the power of a common felon. Bill Sikes may
justly claim “military necessity” for his thefts and murders, if Germany
can do so for hers.</p>

<p>Under Article No. 46 of the Regulations of The Hague, we learn that
“Family honour and rights, individual life and private property must
be respected,” and, under Article No. 47, “all pillage is expressly forbidden.”
But while it was a political necessity to subscribe to that
fundamental formula of civilisation, Germany’s heart recognised no
real need to do so, and secretly, in cold blood, at the inspiration of her
educated and well-born rulers, she plotted the details of a campaign
of murder, rape, arson and pillage, which demanded the breaking of
her oath as its preliminary. Well might her Chancellor laugh at “the
scrap of paper,” which stood between Germany and Belgium, when he
reflected on the long list of sacred assurances his perjured country had
already planned to break.</p>

<p>No viler series of events, in Northern France alone, can be cited
than those extracted from the note-books of captured and fallen
Germans. Such blood-stained pages must be a tithe of those that
returned to Germany, but they furnish a full story of what the rank
and file accomplished at the instigation and example of their officers.
Space precludes quotation; but one may refer the reader to
“Germany’s Violations of the Laws of War,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> published under the
auspices of the French Foreign Office. It is a book that should be on
the tables at the Peace Conference.</p>

<p>We cannot hang an army for these unspeakable offences, or treat those
who burn a village of living beings as we would treat one who made a
bonfire of his fellow-man; nor can we condemn to penal servitude
a whole nation for bestial outrages on humanity, ordered by its Higher
Command and executed by its troops; but at least we may hope soon
to find the offending Empire under police supervision of Europe, with a
ticket-of-leave, whose conditions shall be as strict as an outraged

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> have been many surprises in this war. The evil surprises,
patiently, scientifically, diabolically matured in the dark for the
upsetting and downcasting of a too-trusting world by the enemy of
mankind, whose “Teuton-faith” will surely for ever outrival that
“Punic-faith” which has hitherto been the by-word for perfidious
treachery. The heartening surprises of gallant little Belgium and
Serbia; the renascence of Russia; the wonderful upleap to the needs
of the times by Great, and still more by Greater Britain; and, not least,
the bracing of the loins of our closest Allies just across the water.</p>

<p>In the very beginning, when the Huns tore up that scrap of paper
which represented their honour and their right to a place among decent
dwellers on the earth, and came sweeping like a dirty flood over Belgium
and Northern France, the overpowering remembrance of 1870 still lay
heavy on our sorely-tried neighbours. They had not yet quite found
themselves. The Huns had a mighty reputation for invincibility.
It seemed impossible to stand against them. There were waverings,
even crumplings. There were said to be treacheries in high places.</p>

<p>The black flood swept on. Von Kluck was heading for Paris, and
seemed like to get there. Then suddenly, miraculously as it seemed,
his course was diverted. He was tossed aside and flung back.</p>

<p>And it is good to recall the reason he himself is said to have given for
his failure.</p>

<p>“At Mons the British taught the French how to die.”</p>

<p>That is a great saying and worthy of preservation for all time. Whether
von Kluck said it or not does not matter. It represents and immortalises
a mighty fact.</p>

<p>France was bending under the terrible impact. Britain stood and
died. France braced her loins and they have been splendidly braced
ever since.</p>

<p>The Huns were found to be resistible, vulnerable, breakable. The
old verve and élan came back with all the old fire, and along with
these, new depths of grim courage and tenacity, and, we are told, of
spirituality, which may be the making of a new France greater than the
world has ever known.</p>

<p>And that we shall welcome. France, Belgium, Serbia, Russia have
suffered in ways we but faintly comprehend on this side of the water.
When the Great Settling Day comes, this new higher spirit of France
will, it is to be devoutly hoped, make for restraint in the universal
craving for vengeance, and prove a weighty factor in the righteous
re-adjustment of things and the proper fitting together of the jig-saw
map of Europe.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> can be no defence of the spirit of hatred in which the
Germans have, so fatally for their future, carried on this amazing
mad war of theirs, in violation of all human instincts of self-respect
and self-preservation, to say nothing of the obligations of religion and
morality observed among mankind from the first dawnings of civilisation.
The knavery, the villainy, and the besotted bestiality of it can never
be forgotten, and must never be forgiven, and Louis Raemaekers,
gifted as he is with the rare dramatic genius that discriminates his
Cartoons, has but discharged an obvious patriotic duty in publishing
them to the world at large, as true and faithful witnesses to the unspeakable
and inexpiable abominations wrought throughout Belgium
and French Flanders by the Germans—which, already, in the course
of Divine retribution, have involved their own country in material
losses it will take from three to four generations to repair; and their once
honoured name in contempt, and reprobation, and infamy, wherefrom
it can never be redeemed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as an Englishman, I shrink from giving any emphasis
there may be in my “hand and signature” to these righteously condemnatory
and withering cartoons; and because, each one of them,
as I turn to it, brings more and more crushingly home to me the transcending
sin of England—of every individual Englishman with a vote
for Members of Parliament—in not having prepared for this war; a sin
that has implicated us in the destruction of the whole rising generation
of the flower of our manhood; and, before this date, would have brought
us under subjection to Germany but for the confidence placed by the
rank and file of the British people and nation in Lord Kitchener of
Khartum.</p>

<p>Now—face to face with enemies—from the Kaiser downward to his
humblest subjects—animated by the highest, noblest ideals, but again
perverted for a time—as in the case of their ancestors in the Middle
Ages—by a secular epidemic of “Panmania,” they are to be faced not
with idle reproaches and revilings, still less with undignified taunts
and gibes, but with close-drawn lips and clenched teeth, in the determination
that, once having cast Satan out of them, he shall be bound
down to keep the peace of Christendom—“for a thousand years.”</p>

by avaricious and fraudful ways; for the sin whereof he was sentenced
after death to the unresting labour of rolling up a hill in Tartarus, a
huge unhewn block of stone, which so soon as he gets it to the hill top,
for all his efforts, rolls down again. In classical representation of the
scene he is associated with Tantalus and Ixion; Tantalus, who,
presuming too much on his relations with Zeus, was after death afflicted
with an unquenchable thirst amidst flowing fountains and pellucid
lakes—like the lakes of “The Thirst of the Antelope” in the marvellous
mirages of Rajputana and Mesopotamia—that ever elude his anguished
approaches; and with Ixion, the meanest and basest of cheats, and
most demoniac of murderers, whose posthumous punishment was in
being stretched, and broken, and bound, in the figure of the svastika,
on a wheel which, self-moved—like the wheels of the vision of Ezekiel—whirls
for evermore round and round the abyss of the nether world.
The moral of these tortures is that we may well and most wisely leave

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Nothing</span> has damned the Germans more in the eyes of other
nations, belligerent and neutral alike, and nothing will have a
more subtle and lasting influence on future relations, than the revelation
of stealthy preparation for conquest under a mask of innocent and
friendly intercourse. The whole process of “peaceful penetration,”
pursued in a thousand ways with infernal ingenuity and relentless
determination, is an exhibition of systematic treachery such as all the
Macchiavellis have never conceived. Germany has revealed herself
as a nation of spies and assassins. To take advantage of a neighbour’s
unsuspecting hospitality, to enter his house with an air of open
friendship, in order to stab him in the back at a convenient moment,
is an act of the basest treachery, denounced by all mankind in all ages.
No one would be more shocked by it in private life than the Germans
themselves. But when it is undertaken methodically on a national
scale under the influence of <i lang="de">Deutschland über Alles</i>, the same conduct
becomes ennobled in their eyes, they throw themselves into it with
enthusiasm and lose all sense of honour. Such is the moral perversion
worked by Kultur and the German theory of the State.</p>

<p>An inevitable consequence is that in future the movements and proceedings
of Germans in other countries will be watched with intense
suspicion, and if Governments do not prevent the sort of thing depicted
by Mr. Raemaekers the people will see to it themselves. The cartoon
is not, of course, intended to reflect personally on the owner of Krupp’s
works, who is said to be a gentle-minded and blameless lady. It is her
misfortune to be associated by the chance of inheritance with the
German war machine and one of the underhand methods by which it has
pursued its aims.</p>

Times are indeed changed since the heroic days. Germany
has still her great Greek scholars, one or two of them among the greatest
living, men who know, and can feel, the spirit, as well as the letter, of
the old Classics. Do they remember to-day what the relation of the
Goddess of Wisdom was to the God of War, in Homer, when, to use the
Latin names which are perhaps more familiar to the general reader than
the Greek, Mars “indulged in lawless rage,” and Jove sent Juno and

<p>It is most true. Such has ever been War for War’s sake, and when
the Germans themselves are wounded and beaten, they complain like
Mars of old of “lawless force.”</p>

<p>But Raemaekers has introduced another touch more Roman than
Greek, and reminding us perhaps of Tacitus rather than of Homer.</p>

<p>Who was Caligula, and what does his name mean? “Little Jackboots,”
in his childhood the spoiled child of the camp, as a man, and
Cæsar, the first of the thoroughly mad, as well as bad, Emperors of
Rome, the first to claim divine honours in his lifetime, to pose as an
artist and an architect, an orator and a <i lang="fr">littérateur</i>, to have executions
carried out under his own eyes, and while he was at meals; who made
himself a God, and his horse a Consul.</p>

<p>Minerva blacking the boots of Caligula—it is a clever combination!</p>

<p>But there is an even worse use of Pallas, which War and the German
War-lords have made. They have found a new Pallas of their own,
not the supernal Goddess of Heavenly Wisdom and Moderation, but her
infernal counterfeit, sung of by a famous English poet in prophetic
lines that come back to us to-day with new force.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Of</span> all forms of “Kultur” or “frightfulness” that which
materialises in “the terror which flieth by night” is to the
intelligent mind at one and the same time the most insensate and
damnable. It fails to accomplish, either in Paris or in London, the
subjugation by terror of the people for which Germans seem to hope.
It is only in German imagination that it accomplishes “material and
satisfactory damage to forts, camps, arsenals, and fortified towns.”
In reality it inflicts misery and death upon a mere handful of people
(horrible as that may be) and destroys chiefly the homes of the poor.
It serves no military end, and the damage done is out of all proportion
to the expenditure of energy and material used to accomplish it.</p>

<p>The fine cartoon which Raemaekers has drawn to bring home to
the imagination what this form of “Kultur” stands for makes it
easy for us in London to sympathise with our brothers and sisters in
Paris. We have as yet been spared daylight raids in the Metropolitan
area, and so we needed this cartoon to enable us to realise fully what
“Kultur” by indiscriminate Zeppelin bombs means.</p>

<p>Who cannot see the cruel drama played out in that Paris street? The
artist has assembled for us in a few living figures all the actors. The
dead woman; the orphaned child, as yet scarcely realising her loss;
the bereaved workman, calling down the vengeance of Heaven upon
the murderers from the air; the stern faces of the <i lang="fr">sergents de ville</i>,
evidently feeling keenly their impotence to protect; and in the
background other <i lang="fr">sergents</i>, the lines of whose bent backs convey in a
marvellous manner and with a touch of real genius the impression of
tender solicitude for the injured they are tending. And faintly indicated,
further still in the background, the crowd that differs little, whether it
be French or English, in its deeper emotions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> often have I been asked by sorrow-stricken mothers and
wives: “Why does not Providence intervene either to stop, this
war, or at least to check its cruelties and horrors?” If for many
amongst us not yet bereaved this European massacre is a puzzle, it
should not cause us dismay or surprise if the widow or son-bereaved
mother lifts up her hands exclaiming: “Why did not God save him?
Why did He let him be shot down by those Huns?”</p>

<p>Truth to tell, God has, so to speak, tied up His own hands in setting
ours free. When He placed the human race upon the surface of this
planet He dowered them with freedom, giving to each man self-determining
force, by the exercise of which he was to become better than a
man or worse than a beast. Good and evil, like wheat and cockle, grow
together in the same field. The winnowing is at harvest-time, not before.
Meanwhile, we ourselves have lived to see the fairest portions of this
fair creation of God changed from a garden into a desert—pillaged,
ravaged, and brought to utter ruin by shot and shell, sword and fire.
When I have said this, I have but uttered a foreword to the hideous
story, spoken the prologue only of the “frightful” tragedy. We are
all familiar with at least some of the revolting facts and details with
which the German soldiery has been found charged and convicted by
Commissions appointed to investigate the crimes and atrocities adduced
against them. The verdicts of French, Belgian, and English tribunals
are unanimous. They all agree that Germany has been caught red-handed
in her work of dyeing the map of Europe red with innocent blood.</p>

<p>When you bend your eyes to the pathetic cartoon standing opposite
this letterpress, is there not brought home to you in a way, touching
even to tears, the “frightful” consequences of the misuse of human
powers, more especially of the attribute of freedom? If Germany
had chosen to use, instead of brute force, moral force, what a great,
grand, and glorious mission might have been hers to-day. If, instead
of trying the impossible task of dominating the whole world with her
iron hand upon its throat and her iron heel upon its foot, she had been
satisfied with the portion of the map already belonging to her, and had
not by processes of bureaucratic tyranny driven away millions of her
subjects who preferred liberty to slavery, America to Germany, by
this date she might have consolidated an Empire second in the world to
none but one. Alas! in her over-reaching arrogance she has, on the
contrary, set out to de-Christianise, de-civilise, and even de-humanise
the race for which Christ lived and died.</p>

<p>Our high mission it is to try to save her from herself. Already I
can read written in letters of blood carved into the gravestone of her
corrupted greatness,</p>

  </div>
  <div class="attrib"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="center">
“Good Faith unstained, and Truth all-unadorned.”
</p>

<p class="drop-cap it"><i lang="la"><span class="smcap1">Nuda</span> Veritas</i>: it was Horace who in a famous Ode first
presented the figure of Truth thus. And whom did he make her
companions and sisters? They were three, and their names were
“Modesty,” “Fair Dealing,” and “Good Faith.” The four sisters
do indeed go together in a quadruple alliance and <i lang="it">entente</i>, and when one
is flouted or estranged, the others are alienated and become enemies too.</p>

<p>The Germans were believed to be—some few still believe them to be—a
“truth-loving nation.” They had a passion, we were told, for truth,
for accuracy, for scientific exactness. Theirs might be a blunt and brutal
frankness, but they were at least downright and truthful.</p>

<p>Well, they first flouted Modesty—they bragged and blustered, bluffed
and “bounded.” They could not keep it up. They had to act. Fair
Dealing went by the board. Then Good Faith became impossible, for,
as this very von Bethmann-Hollweg declared, “Necessity knew no law.”
Now they have forsaken Truth. They must deceive their own people.
The “lie” has entered into their soul. Never was so systematic a use
made of falsehoods small and great.</p>

<p>But Truth expelled is not powerless. Naked, she is still not weaponless.
She has her little “periscope,” her magic mirror, which shows
the liar himself, as well as the world, what he is like. And she has
another weapon, as those who know their “Paradise Lost” will
remember:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bright Ithuriel’s lance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Truth kindling truth where’er it glance.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not shown here, for it is invisible, but none the less potent. With
it Truth can indeed “shame the devil.” She not only shows what the
liar is like outside, but reveals his inner hideousness, and actual shape,
for all to see.</p>

<p>There are many sayings about Truth, and they are all awkward for
the liar. “Truth will out,” said a witty English judge, “even in an
affidavit.” It will out, even in a German Chancellor’s <i lang="fr">démenti</i>.</p>

<p>The most famous is</p>

<p class="center vspace">
“<i lang="la">Magna est veritas et prævalet</i>”<br>

“Great is Truth and she prevails,” in the end.
</p>

<p>Yes, “She is on the path, and nothing will stop her.” She started
on the hills of the little but free republic of Switzerland; she is slowly
traversing the plains of the vast free republic of America. Her last
contest will be over the Germans themselves.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A generation</span> ago a little clique of wise men at Oxford patted
themselves on the back for having discovered “The Historical
Method.” But the common people of all countries have always known
it. The names of the great dead are not forgotten, nor yet the great
things for which they stood. There may be no strict liturgy for the
ancestor worship of the West, but that worship is a simple fact, and
it is a thing that timorous politicians would do well to remember.
Here Raemaekers appeals to his countrymen to regard their past, to
be worthy of the great seamen who took the Dutch Fleet up the
Medway, and lashed brooms to the mast-head of the ships that swept
the sea clear of British enemies.</p>

<p>The Dutch were fighting for their liberty then. Great Britain is
fighting for liberty in Europe to-day—and for Dutch liberty to boot.
The enemy of all liberty uses Holland as a short cut whereby her
pirates of the air can get more quickly to their murder work in England.
Would the hero ancestors, of whom the Dutch so boast, have tolerated
this indignity? The artist seer supplies the answer.</p>

<p>Note the mixture of the ghostly and the real in this vivid and vivacious
drawing. But if it is easy to see through the faint outlines of the
sailor spirits, it is easier for these gallant ghosts to see through the
unrealities of their descendants’ fears and hesitations. The anger of
the heroes is plainly too great for words. How compressed the lips!
How tense the attitude! The hands gripped in the angriest sort of
impatience! Mark the subtle mingling of seaman and burgher in the
poise and figures. Mark particularly van Tromp’s stiffened forefinger
on his staff.</p>

<p>Is the fate of L19 the fruit of our artist’s stinging reminder that
Holland once had nobler spirits and braver days?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="War_and_Christ">War and Christ.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> deliberate war made by Prussia in all those areas which she
can reach or occupy against the symbols and sacred objects of
the Christian faith is a phenomenon in every way worthy of consideration.
It is clearly not a matter of accident. The bombardment at
Rheims Cathedral, for example, can be proved to have been deliberate.
It had no military object; and the subsequent attempts to manufacture
a military reason for it only produced a version of the occurrence
not only incredible but in flat contradiction to the original admissions
of the Germans themselves. But such episodes as those of Rheims
and Louvain merely attract the attention of the world because of the
celebrity of the outraged shrines. All who are familiar with the facts
know that deliberate sacrilege no less than deliberate rape and deliberate
murder has everywhere marked the track of the German
army.</p>

<p>The offence has been malignant. That does not, of course, mean
that it has been irrational; quite the contrary. One fully admits
that Prussia, being what she is, has every cause to hate the Cross, and
every motive to vent the agonised fury of a lost soul upon things sacred
to the God she hates.</p>

<p>The moral suggested by this cartoon of Raemaekers’ must not be
confused with the ridiculous and unhistoric pretence that war itself
is essentially unchristian. When Mr. Bernard Shaw, if I remember
right, drew from the affair of Rheims the astonishing moral that we
cannot have at the same time “glorious wars and glorious cathedrals,”
he might surely have remembered that the age in which Rheims Cathedral
was built, whatever else it was, was not an age of Pacifism. The insult
to Jesus Christ is not in the sword (which in His own words He came to
bring), but in the profanation of the sword. It is in cruelty, injustice,
treachery, unbridled lust, the worship of unrighteous strength—in
fact, in all that can be summed up in the single word “Prussia.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Save</span> for the spiked helmets, the gruesome figures in the foreground
of this cartoon might have belonged in life to any one of
the warring nationalities. It is a noteworthy fact, however, that not
one of the nations at war has shown so little care for its dead as Germany,
whose corpses lie and rot on every front on which they are engaged.</p>

<p>The world cannot blame Germany for the introduction of barbed
wire as an accessory of war, though it is well known that German wire
surpasses any other in sheer devilish ingenuity; not that it is more
effective as an entanglement, but its barbs are longer, and are set more
closely together, than in the wire used by other nationalities; it is, in
short, more frightful, and thus is in keeping with the rest of the accessories
of the German war machine.</p>

<p>But this in the cartoon is normal barbed wire, with its normal burden.
One may question whether the All-Highest War Lord, who in the course
of his many inspections of the various fronts must have seen sights like
this, is ever troubled by the thought that these, his men, lie and hang
thus for his pleasure, that their ghastly fate is a part of his glorious plan.
He set out to remake the world, and here is one of the many results—broken
corpses in the waste.</p>

<p>Part of the plan, broken corpses in the waste. By the waste and the
corpses that he made shall men remember the author and framer of this

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is a significance in this cartoon which I believe will appeal
much more strongly to the firing line than to Home. The Front
distrusts politics, and especially the higher politics. That means the
juggling and wire-pulling of the Chancelleries, and the Front has an
uneasy conviction that at the subtleties and craftiness and cunning of
the diplomatic game we cannot compete with “The Bosche.” Hard
knocks and straight fighting the Front does understand, and at that
game are cheerfully confident of winning in the long run.</p>

<p>It would be bitter news to the fighting men that any peace had
been patched up on any terms but those the Allies soon or late will be in
a position to dictate, to lay down and say flatly, “Take them and have
Peace; or leave them and go on getting licked.” The Front doesn’t like
War. No man who has endured the horrors and savagery and “blood,
mud, and misery” of civilised warfare could pretend to like it. No
man who has endured the long-drawn misery of manning the waterlogged
trenches for days and weeks and months can look forward with anything
but apprehension to another winter of war. No man who has attacked
across the inferno of the shell-and-bullet-swept “neutral ground,” or
has hung on with tight-clenched teeth to the battered ruins of the forward
fire trench under a murderous rain of machine-gun and rifle bullets, a
howling tempest of shells, an earth-shaking tornado of high explosives,
can but long for the day when Peace will be declared and these horrors
will be no more than a past nightmare.</p>

<p>But the Front will “stick it” for another winter or several winters,
will go through many bitter attacks and counter-attacks to win the
complete victory that will ensure, and alone will ensure, lasting peace.
We know our limitations and our weaknesses. We admit that, as the
American journalist bluntly put it, we are “poor starters,” but we
know just as surely he was right in completing the phrase, “but darn
good finishers.” Let the “higher politicians” on our side stand down
and leave the fighting men to finish the argument. Let them keep
the ring clear, and let the Front fight it out. The Front doesn’t mind
“taking the responsibility,” and it will give “Kaiser Bill” and
“Little Willie” all the responsibilities they can handle before the
Great Game is over.</p>

<p class="drop-cap r"><span class="smcap1">Raemaekers</span> is pitiless, but never oversteps the truth.
National Debts are ever national millstones, worn around the
neck. They are worn unwillingly, and they are not ornamental;
they are a burden, and the weight is sometimes crushing. A prospect
of that sort seems to be the lot of several of the “Great Powers” of
Europe for the remainder, and the greater portion, of the Twentieth
Century. Though German “civilisation” were more worthy of such a
term and its associations as Kultur ten times over, would it become
any Potentate and his advisers to impose it on so many countries at
such a cost in suffering as all this—and more?</p>

<p>But Kaiser Wilhelm and his crew of State-at-any-price men impose
not on other peoples only: they impose on their own kith and kin.
Look at these three sad and apprehensive figures playing the Loan Game—the
first, the second, the third Loan! Children, says the artist,
passing the coin from one hand to another’s, and getting richer at each
pass!! Yes, children, the German people treated so by a few dominies.
State dominies and the Director (or dupe!) at Berlin! No people gains,
every people loses by incurring a Debt; but in Germany, and to-day!
to incur an indebtedness, contract a loss, does not suffice; the people
must not know it.</p>

<p>Even the children know that coin has not left them richer: many,
very many Germans know the Kultur War to be ruinous: but Berlin
must play the Game still, and assume that the tricks and aims cannot
be understood! It is lack of regard for other nations carried into
German Finance; and all because the bureaucratic military heart is a
stone. The piling up of State paper goes on, but not merrily, as Michael
goes from Darlehnkasse to Reichsbank, one, two, three (and is about
to go the fourth time!). This game of processions to the Kasse does
not increase the available wealth within beleaguered Germany: and the
100-mark Note has no reference to material wealth securing it.</p>

<p>Now, the Commercial magnates of Germany realise the crushing
fact—No indemnity possible!! and what of the Notes which are held?
When shades of night fall heavily, and the Loan Game can be played
no more, will the German people, tricked and impoverished, go to bed
supperless and silent? German finance IS “a scrap of paper.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">True, O</span> Liebknecht, it is indeed a war of rapine, engendered,
planned, and brought about by the nation to which you belong.
Yet, foul as is that nation, its foulness is not greater than your futility,
by which you show up the strength of that which you oppose with as
much effect as our own Snowden and Casement can claim for their
efforts to arrest the work of the Allies.</p>

<p>Men who claim British birth claim also the quality of loyalty, as a
rule, and thus there can be little sympathy with such a one as this
Liebknecht, whom Raemaekers shows as a little ascetic in the presence
of the sombre War Lord. It is part of the plan of Nature that every
country shall breed men like this: men who are constitutionally opposed
to the current of affairs, ridiculously futile, blatantly noisy, the type
of which extreme Socialists and Syndicalists are made. Possessed of a
certain obstinacy which is almost akin to courage, they accomplish
nothing, save to remain in the public eye.</p>

<p>Such is Liebknecht, apostle of a creed that would save the world
by the gospel of mediocrity, were human nature other than it is. But,
in considering this Liebknecht, let us not forget that he has no more love
for England, or for any of the Allies, than the giant whom he attempts
so vainly to oppose; he is an apostle, not of peace, but of mere obstruction,
perhaps well-meaning in his way, but as futile as the Crown Prince,
and as ludicrous.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Some</span> of these drawings remind us that the great cartoonist’s
message was primarily delivered to his own countrymen. They
explain why he was accused, but not convicted, of endangering the
neutrality of the Netherlands. He presents the German monster as a
menace to all freedom, and not least to the freedom of the Dutch people.
Germany’s allies have sold theirs; they are harnessed to the Prussian
war chariot, and must drag it whither the driver bids them, whip in hand.
The nations in arms against Germany are fighting for their own and
each other’s freedom; and the neutrals stand looking anxiously on.
Raemaekers warns them that their freedom too is at stake. He
sees that it will disappear if the Allies fail in the struggle, and he shows
his countrymen what they may expect.</p>

<p>In every country there are some ignoble souls who would rather
embrace servitude than fight for freedom. They have a conscientious
objection to—danger. How far the Dutch Junkers deserve Raemaekers’
satire it is not for foreigners to judge. But we know the type
he depicts—the sporting “nuts,” with their careful get-up, effeminate
paraphernalia and vacuous countenances. So long as they can wear a
sporting costume and carry a gun they are prepared to take a menial
place under a Prussian over-lord and submit with a feeble fatalism to
the loss of national independence. It is light satire in keeping with the
subject, and it provides a relief to the sombre tragedy which is the
artist’s prevailing mood.</p>

Joseph, grown old and feeble, nails up a barricade of planks to

<p>Kultur, the gathered wisdom of the ages, has brought us back to
the same Holy War. What a Christmas! What a Festival of Peace

<p>People ask: Why does God allow it? Is God dead? Foolish questions.
When I was at school I had the good fortune to be under a great teacher

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Genius</span> has set forth the most brutal characteristic of the Hun.
In moments of triumph, invariably he is the bully, and, as
invariably, he wallows in brutality—witness Belgium under his iron
heel and, in this cartoon, stricken Serbia impotent to ward off the
blow about to be dealt by a monstrous fist. That is the Teuton conception
of War, Merry War (<i lang="de">Lustige Krieg</i>)! In the English prize-ring
we have an axiom indelibly impressed upon novices—“Follow up one
stout blow with another—<em>quick!</em>” That, also, is the consummate
art of war. But when a man is knocked out we don’t savage him
as he lies senseless at our feet. The Hun does. His axiom is—“As
you are strong, be merciless!”</p>

<p>In the small pig-eyes, in the gross, sensual lips, the mandril-like
jaw, the misshapen ear, I see not merely a lifelike portrait of a Hun,
but a composite photograph of all Huns, something which should hang
in every house in the kingdom until the terms of such a peace have
been imposed which will make the shambles in Belgium, Poland, and
Serbia an eternal nightmare of the past, never to be repeated in the
future. And over the anæmic hearts of the Trevelyans, the Ramsay
MacDonalds, the Arthur Ponsonbys, who dare to prattle of a peace
that shall not humiliate Germany, I would have this cartoon tattooed,
not in indigo, but in vermilion.</p>

<p>If Ulysses Grant exacted from the gallant Robert Lee “Unconditional
Surrender,” and if our generation approves—as it does—that grim
ultimatum, what will be the verdict of posterity should we as a nation—we
who have been spared the unspeakable horrors under which other
less isolated countries have been “bled white”—descend to the infamy
of a compromise between the Powers of Darkness and Light? The
Huns respect Force, and nothing else. Mercy provokes contempt and
laughter. I hold no brief for reprisals upon helpless women and
children; I am not an advocate of what is called the “commercial
extermination of Germany”; but it is my sincerest conviction that
criminals must be punished. The Most Highest War Lord and his
people, not excluding the little children who held high holiday when
the <i>Lusitania</i> was torpedoed, are—<span class="allsmcap">CRIMINALS</span>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap r"><span class="smcap1">Raemaekers, the</span> master of an infinite variety of moods and touch,
reserves a special category of scorn for von Tirpitz. Savage cruelty
in war, the wanton destruction of life and property, the whole gospel
of frightfulness—these things have been abandoned (so the historians
tell us), not because savagery was bad morals, but because it was the
worst way of making war. It was wiser to take the enemy’s property
and put it to your own use than to destroy it. If it was plundered
it was wasted. It was wiser to spare men, women, and children,
so that they should be better subjects if they remained conquered,
less irreconcilable enemies, if they were restored to their old allegiance.
Besides, murder, plunder, and rapine demoralised your men. They made
them less efficient troops for fighting. Doubtless the argument is
sound. But it would never have been accepted had not the horrors
of savagery been utterly loathsome and repulsive to the nations that
abandoned them.</p>

<p>Conventions in the direction of humanity are not, then, <em>artificial</em>
restrictions in the use of force. They are natural restrictions, because
all Christian and civilised people would far rather observe them than
not. Germany has revelled in abandoning every restraint. Raemaekers
shows the cruelty, the wickedness of this in scores of his drawings.
Here it is its folly that he emphasises.</p>

<p>The submarine is no longer a death-dealing terror. It has become
a blubbering fish. And the author of its crimes is no diabolical triton,
but a semi-imbecile old dotard, round whom his evil—but terrified—brood
have clustered; they fawning on him in terror, he fondling
them in shaky, decrepit fondness. Note the flaccid paunch, the withered
top, and the foolish, hysterical face. How the full-dress cocked hat
shames his nakedness!</p>

<p>And this, remember, is the German High Admiral as history will
know him, when the futility of his crimes is proved, their evil put
out of memory, and only their foolishness remains!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Curriculum">The Curriculum</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> nations are being educated amain, let us hope. Germany has
prided herself on her education, her learning, and on her Kultur.
To-day she is beyond the calculation of all that foresight which has
been her boast, and foible. Human nature, other than German, has
not been on the national curriculum, and, as in other departments
of study, what has not been reduced to rule and line is beyond the ken
and apprehension. How stupendously wrong a Power which could
count, and into a European War! on insurrection in India, the Cape,
and other parts of the British Empire! and how naively did Herr von
Bethmann-Hollweg disclose the <i lang="de">Zeitgeist</i> of German rulers when with
passion he declared Britain to be going to war for “a scrap of paper”!
A purpose to serve, a treaty becomes “a scrap”—in German courtly
hands.</p>

<p>The artist depicts a scene, with masterly pencil, where von Bethmann-Hollweg
himself is charged by the All-Highest to be schoolmaster.
It is a grim department of the training. Think of the unseen as well
as that shown. What you do see is the lordly, truculent Kaiser, raising
that menacing finger again. In spacious chair, he sits defiant, aggressive,
as a ferocious captain; and there opposite is the “great Chancellor,”
bent, submissive, apprehensive, tablet and pencil ready to take down
the very word of Kaiserly wisdom and will. What is it? The day’s
fare for a week! reaching a climax of “No dinner” on Saturday,
and “Hate” on Sunday! Educative! of course it will be.</p>

<p>Some day, not so far, even the German people will not regard the
orders of the Army and Navy Staff, the cruel mercies of the Junkers,
as a revelation of Heaven’s will. Three pounds of sugar for a family’s
monthly supply will educate, even when the gospel of force has been
preached for fifty years to a docile people. Many of us are in “a
strait betwixt two” as we see how thousands of inoffensive old men,
women, and children are made to suffer, are placed by the All-Highest
in this Copper and Hate School. It is not this, that, and the other
that causes this, but the Director of the School, who does not, while
the miserable scholars do, know what it is to endure “No dinner,”
not only on Saturdays, but many other days. And all to gratify the
mad projectors imposing Kultur on an unwilling world!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Whether</span> the type here taken is a true criticism of a commercial
attitude in a neutral State like Holland, it does not become us
to discuss. Raemaekers is a Dutchman, and doubtless a patriotic
Dutchman. And the patriot, and the patriot alone, has not only the
right but the duty of criticising his own country.</p>

<p>For us it is better to regard the figure as an international, and often
anti-national, character who exists in all nations, and who, even in a
belligerent country like our own, can often contrive to be neutral
and worse than neutral. A prosperous bully with the white waistcoat
and coarse, heavily cuffed hands, with which such prosperity very
frequently clothes itself, is represented as thrusting food in the starved
face of an evicted Belgian and saying: “Eat and hold your tongue.”</p>

<p>The situation is worthy of such record, if only because it emphasises
an element in the general German plot against the world which is
often forgotten in phrases about fire and sword. The Prussianised
person is not only a military tyrant; he is equally and more often a
mercantile tyrant. And what is in this respect true of the German
is as true or truer of the Pro-German.</p>

<p>The cosmopolitan agent of Prussia is a commercial agent, and
works by those modern methods of bribing and sacking, of boycott
and blackmail, which are not only meaner, but often more cruel, than
militarism. For anyone who realises the power of such international
combinations, there is the more credit due to the artists
and men of letters who, like Raemaekers himself, have decisively chosen
their side while the issue was very doubtful. And among the Belgian
confrères there must certainly have been many who showed as much
courage as any soldier, when they decided not to eat and be silent,
but to starve and to speak.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> Homeric warfare to subterranean conflict of modern trenches
is a far cry, and Ares, God of Battles, may well yawn at the entertainment
with which the Demon of War is providing him. But the
spectator of this grim “revue” lacks something of the patience of its
creator, and our Mephistopheles, marking the god’s protest, will doubtless
hurry the scene and diversify it with new devilries to restore his interest.
Indeed, that has happened since Raemaekers made his picture.</p>

<p>The etiquette of butchery has become more complicated since Troy
fell, yet it has been so far preserved till now that the fiend measures
Ares with his eyes and speculates as to how far the martial god may
be expected to tolerate his novel engines. Will asphyxiating gas,
and destruction of non-combatants and neutrals on land and sea, trouble
him? Or will he demand the rules of the game, and decline to applaud
this satire on civilisation, although mounted and produced regardless
of cost and reckoning?</p>

<p>As the devil’s own entertainment consists in watching the effects of
his masterpiece on this warlike spectator, so it may be that those who
“staged” the greatest war in mankind’s history derive some bitter instruction
from its reception by mankind. They know now that it
is condemned by every civilised nation on earth; and before these
lines are published their uncivilised catspaws will have ample reason
to condemn it also. Neutrals there must be, but impartials none.</p>

<p>The sense and spirit of the thinking world now go so far with
human reason that they demand a condition of freedom for all men
and nations, be they weak or powerful. That ideal inspires the
majority of human kind, and it follows that the evolution of morals
sets strongly on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p>“War,” says Bernhardi, “gives a biologically just decision, since
its decisions rest on the very nature of things.” So be it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Peace_Woman">“The Peace Woman”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this humorous yet pathetic cartoon—humorous because of its
truth to the type, and pathetic because of the futility of the effort
depicted—with unfailing skill the artist shows the folly of the cry
“Peace! Peace!” when there is none. In the forefront is a type
of woman publicist who can never be happy unless the limelight secured
by vocal effort and the advocacy of a “crazy” cause is focussed upon
her. She calls “Peace!” that the world may hear, not attend. Behind
her stands that other type of detached “peace woman,” who has,
judging from her placid yet grieved expression, apparently scarcely
realised that the War is too serious and has its genesis in causes too
deep-rooted to be quelled by her or her kind. One can imagine her
saying: “A war! How terrible! It must be stopped.”</p>

<p>The soldier, who is wise enough to prefer armour-plate even to a
shield provided by substantially built peace women clad in white, looks
on amused. The thinking world as a whole so looks on at “Arks”
launched by American millionaire motor manufacturers, and at Pacifist
Conferences held whilst the decision as to whether civilisation or savagery
shall triumph, and might be greater than right, yet hangs in the balance.
There must be no thought of peace otherwise than as the ultimate
reward of gallant men fighting in a just cause, and until with it can come
permanent security from the “Iron Fist” of Prussian Militarism and
aggression, and the precepts of Bernhardi and his kind are shown to
be false. Those who talk of peace in the midst of “frightfulness,”
of piracy, of reckless carnage and colossal sacrifices of human life
which are the fruits of an attempt to save by military glory a
crapulous dynasty, however good their intention, lack both mental and
moral perspective.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Self-satisfied_Burgher">The Self-satisfied Burgher</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> artist has depicted the ordinary attitude of a self-satisfied
burgher not only in Holland but in other countries also. “What
does it matter if we are annexed afterwards, so long as we remain
neutral now?” That is the sort of speech made by selfish merchants
in some of the neutral countries, especially those of Scandinavian origin.
It is really a variety of the old text: “Let us eat, drink, and be merry;
for to-morrow we die.” Why not, it is urged, make the best of present
facilities? As long as we are left alone we can pursue our ordinary
industrialism. We can heap up our percentages and profits. Our trade
is in a fairly flourishing condition, and we are making money. No one
knows what the future may bring; why, therefore, worry about it?
Besides, if the worst comes to the worst and Germany annexes us, are
we quite sure that we shall be in a much worse condition than we are
now? It will be to the interest of Berlin that we should carry on our
usual industrial occupations. Our present liberty will probably not be
interfered with, and a change of masters does not always mean ruin.</p>

<p>So argues the self-satisfied burgher. If life were no more than a
mere matter of getting enough to eat and drink and of having a balance
at the banker’s, his view of the case might pass muster. But a national
life depends on spiritual and ideal interests, just as a man’s life “consisteth
not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”
Freedom is the only principle of growth, and freedom is the one thing
which German militarism desires to make impossible for all those whom
she gathers into her fold. The loss of liberty means the ruin of all
those ends for which a State exists. Even the material prosperity
which the self-satisfied burgher desires will be definitely sacrificed by
a submission to Teutonic autocracy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">War</span> is a fiery winnower of incapacities. Many reputations
have gone to the scrap-heap since August, 1914. None more
surely than that of the braggart Crown Prince. It is said that
this terrible catastrophe was largely of his bringing about and his
great desire and hope.</p>

<p>Well—he has got his desire, and more than he expected.</p>

<p>He was going to do mighty things—to smash through the frontier
and lead the German hordes triumphantly through France. And
what has he done?</p>

<p>In the treacherous surprise of the moment he got across the frontier,
and there the weighty French fist met the Imperial optic, and has since
developed many stars in it. He has been held, wasting men, time,
opportunity, and his own little apology for a soul. He has done
nothing to justify his position or even his existence. He has wrecked
his home-life by wanton indulgence. He has made himself notorious
by his private lootings of the châteaux cursed with his presence.</p>

<p>Even in 1870 the native cupidity of the far finer breed of conquerors
could not resist the spoils of war, and, to their eternal disgrace, trainloads
of loot were sent away to decorate German homes—as burglars’
wives might wear the jewellery acquired by their adventurous menfolk
in the course of their nefarious operations.</p>

<p>But we never heard of “Unser Fritz,” the then Crown Prince,
ransacking the mansions he stayed in. He was a great man and a
good—the very last German gentleman. And this decadent is his
grandson!</p>

<p>“Unser Fritz” was a very noble-looking man. His grandson—oh,
well, look at him and judge for yourselves! Of a surety the sight
is calculated to heighten one’s amazement that any nation under
the sun, or craving it, could find in such a personality, even as
representative of a once great but now exploding idea, anything
whatever even to put up with, much less to worship and die for.</p>

<p>The race of Hohenzollern has wilted and ravelled out to this. The
whole world, outside Prussia, devoutly hopes ere long to have seen
the last of it.</p>

<p>It has been at all times, with the single exception above noted, a
hustling, grabbing, self-seeking race. May the eyes of Germany soon
be opened! Then, surely, it will be thrust back into the obscurity
whence heaven can only have permitted it to escape for the flagellation
of a world which was losing its ideals and needed bracing back with a
sharp, stern twist.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> one sits down to think, there are few things in connection
with the devastating War now raging, wild-beast-like,
almost throughout the length and breadth of Europe, so appalling
as the application of science and man’s genius to the work of decimating
the human species.</p>

<p>Early in the conflict, which is being fought for the basal principles
of civilisation and moral human conduct, one was made to realise
that the Allied Powers were opposed to an enemy whose resources
were only equalled by his utter negation of the rules of civilised warfare.
Soon, to the horrors of machine-guns and of high-explosive shells of
a calibre and intensity of destructive force never before known, were
added the diabolical engines for pouring over the field of battle
asphyxiating gases. We know the horrors of that mode of German
“frightfulness,” and some of us have seen its effects in the slowly
dying victims in hospitals. But that was not enough. Yet other
methods of “frightfulness” and savagely which would have disgraced
the most ruthless conquerors of old, were to be applied by the German
Emperor in his blasphemous “Gott mit uns” campaign. And against
the gallant sons of Belgium, France, England, and Russia in turn
were poured out with bestial ingenuity the jets and curtains of “liquid
fire” which seared the flesh and blinded the eyes. For this there will
be a reckoning if God be still in heaven whilst the world trembles with
the shock of conflict, and the souls of men are seared.</p>

<p>Raemaekers in this cartoon shows not only the horror of such a
method of warfare, but also, with unerring pencil, the unwavering
spirit of the men who have to meet this “frightfulness.” There is
a land to be redeemed, and women and children to be avenged, and
so the fighting men of the allied nations go gallantly on with their stern,
amazed faces set towards victory.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Very</span> happily and very graphically has Raemaekers here
pointed the contrast between the Gargantuan hopes with which
the Kaiser and his Junker army embarked on the War, and the
exiguous and shadowy fruits of their boasted victories up to the
present. They foretold a triumphal entry into the conquered capital
of France within a month of the opening of hostilities. Yet the irony
of Fate has, slowly but surely, cooled the early fever of anticipation.
The only captured town where the All-Highest has found an opportunity
of lifting his voice in exultant pæan is Nish, a secondary city
of the small kingdom of Serbia. There, too, he perforce delayed his
jubilation until the lapse of some eighteen months after the date
provisionally and prematurely fixed in the first ebullition of over-confidence,
for his triumphal procession through Paris.</p>

<p>Nish is a town of little more than 20,000 inhabitants; about the
size of Taunton or Hereford—smaller than Woking or Dartford.
Working on a basis of comparative populations, the Emperor would
have to repeat without more delay his bravery at Nish in 150 towns
of the same size before he could convince his people that he is even
now on the point of fulfilling his first rash promises to them of the
rapid overthrow of his foes. Pursuing the same calculation, he is
bound to multiply his present glories 350 times before he can count
securely on spending a night as conquering hero in Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>Even the Kaiser must know in his heart that woefully, from his own
and his people’s point of view, did he overestimate his strength at
the outset. For the time he contents himself with the backwater of
Nish for the scene of his oratory of conquest. His vainglorious words
may well prove in their environment the prelude of a compulsory
confession of failure, which is likely to come at a far briefer interval
than the eighteen months which separate the imaginary hope of Paris
from the slender substance of Nish.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> the many inventions which German ingenuity and science
have devised for the effective conduct of this war, and for the
elevation of Germany to supremacy in the world, the most
repellent in general estimation has been the use of fire; but this
commends itself with peculiar zest to Mephistopheles, who here sits
on a chair beside the telephone and calls up the Prussian Palace at
Potsdam. He cannot restrain his admiration and delight at this new
invention. It is entirely to his heart. He sits with one leg rested on
the knee of the other; and you will notice that the foot of this leg,
with its carefully careless drawing, suggests a cloven hoof, while the
scanty hair, by its arrangement, gives the effect of a pair of horns:
even in this figure, an ornament of high-class society, there linger the
signs of the half-bestial figure of Satan. The face is wholly the countenance
of the devil, conceived as the man of society, who has moved
amid the luxury of the most fashionable circles, where his wit and
cynicism have made him popular.</p>

<p>All his surroundings are suited to his character. The chair on which
he sits has goat’s feet, and its back is the bearded head of a goat.
The very telephone has something about it subtly suggestive of the
devil. A gorgeously attired flunkey who stands behind the chair does
not attempt to conceal his delight at the joke; for he is not the
conventional English serving man, who betrays no appreciation of
what is said by his master. He is in perfect sympathy with the devil,
for he is himself a devil. The nature of the devil is expressed more
completely in the footman than in the master. His legs are the legs
of a goat, and his feet are its cloven hoofs; and, whereas on the master’s
head the idea of horns is suggested only by the arrangement of the
hair, horns openly protrude from the bald skull of the serving-man.
There is no veneer of fashion and intellect and wit here: the hateful
animalism of the face is in keeping with the animal limbs.</p>

<p>From these surroundings comes the message to Potsdam. The
Prussian monarchs have always been given to the outward forms of
religion in their messages. For every success which they have
announced to their people they have professed their appreciation of
the good conduct of that German God whom alone they recognise.
But Mephistopheles has been struck with one omission in the series
of messages from the Kaiser at the front announcing the stages of his
success. There has been no expression of thanks to the “dear old God”
for the application of fire as an agent of victory, and he calls up his
friend at Potsdam to twit him with the omission.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> position of Holland as a neutral state is one of increasing
difficulty. She has no desire to join in the war on either side; all she
asks for is to be left alone to pursue her own mercantile path and to
maintain the rights and privileges of her kingdom. Naturally enough,
however, she feels very uneasy at the close proximity of a power like
Germany, which has shown how little the independence of nationalities
is regarded in her military councils. Holland, it must be remembered,
has the example of Belgium before her eyes. She knows therefore
what it must mean to be overrun by Hunnish hordes, and to lose at
once the vitality of her national life and the security of her towns.</p>

<p>Raemaekers’ picture graphically depicts the efforts that are being
made by German agents to convert Holland’s neutrality into an active
support of Berlin. The German oculist trying on spectacles persuades
his patient that the Dutch cry “Oranje Boven” is synonymous with
“Deutschland über Alles.” In the earlier stages of the war it did not
interfere with German projects that Holland should remain neutral,
for hers was a useful country through which to import the various
supplies of munitions and food which Germany needed. Now, however,
that the stringency of the British blockade has so largely interfered
with the transit of goods, Germany may discover it to be to her advantage
to possess Holland as an Ally. Hence the zeal of the Teuton
oculist and his insidious attempts to make the Dutchman see things
as Germany sees them. The fact is, of course, that the possession of
the Dutch coast line would add not a little to German facilities in her
submarine and Zeppelin attacks.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> question uppermost in most of our minds at the present
moment is, I take it, what are the Huns thinking? And, in
particular, what are the Willies thinking?</p>

<p>Raemaekers answers the question with his wonderful pencil
in this cartoon.</p>

<p>We know that the Huns prepared for and started this war with a
bee in their bonnets, a bee which buzzed about Xerxes, Hannibal,
Alexander and Napoleon. The two Willies were avowedly “out”
for what they call “Weltmacht,” or world dominion. Bernhardi put
it in tabloid form:—“Weltmacht oder niedergang.”</p>

<p>If one fact shines out conspicuously after these dreadful months of
slaughter it is this—that the Willies will not achieve world dominion.</p>

<p>What are their inmost thoughts—now?</p>

<p>Raemaekers pourtrays the All Highest with snow white hair and a
dyed moustache still pointing upwards. The dyed moustache seems
to me the keynote of the cartoon—la petite note qui chante. It should
be white to match the hair, and drooping. What an effort to keep a
stiff upper lip, when day after day the War Lord scans the casualty
lists, and realises—as he must—that sooner or later the deluded Fatherland
will know what he knows, and draw from that knowledge conclusions
which he is powerless to modify or avert!</p>

<p>They have drunk to “Der Tag.” And that Day is about to dawn,
the DAY which will present them to their own people as discredited
rulers and humiliated schemers.</p>

<p>The Ramsay Macdonalds, the Charles Trevelyans, the Arthur
Ponsonbys—et id genus omne—have prattled about the inexpediency
of humiliating Germany. What a waste of foolish words! Can the
imagination of Man conceive of any greater humiliation than that
which Destiny, not the Allies, must inflict upon Hunland? That
humiliation, inevitably, will come from within, and prey like a hideous
cancer upon the body politic. No publicist, however prescient, can
measure its ravages, for they are hidden from our sight. But none
can doubt that, like a cancer, these ravages will grow and spread till
the world gapes aghast at them. Whatever punishment we may be
able to inflict upon these Baby-Killers and Pirates will be as nothing
compared with the humiliation which, pede claudo, dogs the steps of
failure and bankruptcy.</p>

<p>In this cartoon, the younger of the two Weary Willies is fitly habited
in sable. He is in deepest mourning for the last of his dynasty—<span class="allsmcap">HIMSELF</span>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Current</span> experience is proving that war is a grim condition of
life, and that none can escape its effects. No religious or philosophic
precept is potent enough in practical application to prevent its
outbreak or to stay its course. The strong man of military age, who
claims the right to pursue normal peaceful avocations when his country
is at war, pleads guilty, however involuntarily, to aberrations of both
mind and heart.</p>

<p>There are few who do not conscientiously cherish repugnance for war,
but practically none of those to whom so natural a sentiment makes
most forcible appeal deem it a man’s part to refuse a manifest
personal call of natural duty. The conscientious objector to combatant
service may in certain rare cases deserve considerate treatment,
but very short shrift should await the able-bodied men who, from
love of ease or fear of danger, simulate conscientious objection in order
to evade a righteous obligation.</p>

<p>Lack of imagination may be at times as responsible for the sin of the
shirker as lack of courage. Patriotism is an instinct which works as
sluggishly among the unimaginative as among the cowardly and the
selfish. The only cure for the sluggish working of the patriotic instinct
among the cowardly and the selfish is the sharp stimulus of condign
punishment. But among the unimaginative it may be worth experimenting
by way of preliminary with earnest and urgent appeals to
example such as is offered not only by current experience, but also
by literature and history. No shirkers would be left if every subject
of the Crown were taught to apprehend the significance of Henley’s
interrogation:</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is interesting to consider how absolute has been the rupture of
Germany’s oath, as taken on her subscription to the Hague Convention.
In the light of the violation of the neutrality of Belgium—that
colossal infamy, destined to rank for all time as the greatest and vilest
betrayal to which a civilised nation has ever sunk—the rest, considered
singly, may seem lesser offences. Yet the violation of the neutrality
of Luxemberg; the violation of the French frontier before declaration
of War; the violation of the Geneva Convention; the slaughter of
prisoners and wounded; the rape and arson, loot and murder; the
use of forbidden bullets and forbidden asphyxiating gas; the bombardment
of unfortified towns; the treachery and needless cruelty
inflicted against civil populations; the crimes on the high seas—all
tower together into such a massive indictment as no nation has yet
been driven by her tyrants to endure. But beyond this, the warfare,
as carried on by Germany’s creatures in all lands, alone amounts to
a wide infraction of the promise that Count Münster signed at the
Hague for the German Empire in 1899. “Treacherous methods of
warfare” were then abjured by a people which has sunk to such depths
of treachery that Judas, Brutus, Cassius, in the threefold jaws of
Dis, might protest at their intrusion.</p>

<p>The French arms for Tripoli were a typical trifle; they sink into
subject for laughter before the understanding between France and
Italy and the knowledge of what Germany has done since that incident.
And now, in the hour of need, we learn that Teutonic inspiration has
taken another hint from Frederick the Great. Forged English paper
money begins to circulate in the Fatherland.</p>

<p>To this they have come; and since English Treasury notes do not
go to Germany, and we are told that all leaving this country return
swiftly to it, let us trust that any presentation of the forged paper in
London may win the attention it deserves.</p>

“Professors” and others have sought to exonerate Germany for the

“attitude of mind” which is exemplified by the question of the German
Anti-Bellicist, and of the German apostles of “Kultur” in general.
It is not sheer muddleheadedness, but has been brought about by a
calculated, immoral perversion of intellect.</p>

<p>It is an attitude of mind that is lost to a sense of humour—the
absence of which indeed is a German national characteristic. And

<p>William of Potsdam, portrayed in this cartoon as a Cook’s tourist,
chatters with rage whenever he is laughed at. Behold here the All
Highest in a composite portrait of Himself in a few of his favourite
“stunts.” Mark the hat of the mighty hunter who slays hecatombs
of wild boars without running any risk to his august person, the asker
of innumerable and importunate questions (he expected one of our
generals to tell him the official length of our ballet dancers’ skirts!),
the snapshotter, the wearer of English clothes of sporting cut, and
first, last, and all the time—the SPY. Britons forgive and forget easily,
but we may well wonder whether, after this war, high-born Huns all
of them now revealed as spies will be received as of yore by our magnates
and lavishly entertained? Shall we see immense Junkers mixing champagne
and stout in our clubs? Shall we lose our own appetites at the
sight of gracious ladies wolfing our best food with all four feet in the
trough?</p>

<p>I hope not, but I hae ma doots.</p>

<p>What rankles in my humble breast is not so much the barbarity
of the Beast, but the humiliating reflection that we allowed him to
prowl amongst us masquerading as a fat sheep, grazing peacefully
in our verdant pastures!</p>

<p>I submit that all Huns, male and female, should be sent to Coventry
by the Allies for at least one decade. It would be fatuous to suppose
that any Hun could change his character during so brief a period,
but “doing time” may teach him—as it has taught other criminals—that
it pays to be honest. It is not likely that the Baby Killers and
Pirates will recognise any principle except expediency.</p>

<p>It is a comforting thought, also, that the Hun, after this war, will
be ill provided with what schoolboys call—“journey-money.” In the
pleasant land of France, sur les côtes d’azur et éméraude, our ears will
not be split by their raucous, spluttering accents; our eyes will not
be offended by their obese, ridiculous persons. We shall, I hope,
wander in peace through the Eternal City. I remember a young Hun
at Wengen who barged into every skater on the rink not adroit enough
to avoid him. I do not expect to meet him again.</p>

<p>For this alone may the Lord be praised!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the present crisis of Belgian affairs there is much to remind the
historical student of the events which led to the fall of Antwerp
in 1585, and the outrageous invasion of the Southern Netherlands by
the army of Parma. Then, as now, Holland opened her arms to her
wounded and captive sister. The best Flemish scholars and men of
letters emigrated to the land where Cornheert and Spieghel welcomed
them.</p>

<p>Merchants and artisans flocked to a new sphere of energy in
Amsterdam. Several of the professorial chairs in that city, and in
the great universities of Leyden and Harderwijk, were filled by learned
Flemings, and the arts, that had long been flourishing in Brussels, fled
northward to escape from the desolating Spanish scourge. The grim
pencil of Raemaekers becomes tender whenever he touches upon the
relation of the tortured Belgium to her sister, Holland, his own beloved
fatherland.</p>

<p>We do not know yet, in this country, a tithe of the sacrifices
which have been made in Holland to staunch the tears of Belgium.
“Your sufferings are mine, and so are your fortunes,” has been the
motto of the loyal Dutch.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> fight of the one and the four might, in view of the difference
in the size of the combatants, be called quite fairly “the fight
of the one and the fifty-three.” Each of the assailants has his own
character. Germany is represented as a ferocious giant; Austria
follows Prussia’s lead, a little the worse for wear, with a bandaged
head as the souvenir of his former campaign: he does his best to look
and act like Germany. Bulgaria loses not a moment, but puts his
rifle to his shoulder to shoot the small enemy: he acts in his own way,
according to his own character: kill the enemy as quickly as possible
and seize the spoil, that is his principle. Turkey is a rather broken-down
and dilapidated figure, who is preparing to use his bayonet,
but has not got it quite ready. Serbia, erect, with feet firmly planted,
stands facing the chief enemy, a little David against this big Goliath
and his henchman, Austria; and the other two, so recently deadly foes,
now standing shoulder to shoulder, attack him while his attention
is directed on Germany.</p>

<p>The leader and “hero” of this assault is Prussia, big, brutal, remorseless.
The Dutch artist always concentrates the spectator’s attention
on him. You can almost hear the roar coming out of his mouth:
“Gott strafe Serbien.” This is the figure, as Raemaekers paints him,
that goes straight for his object, regardless of moral considerations.
Serbia is in his way, and Serbia must be trampled in the mire. The
artist’s sympathy is wholly with Serbia, who is pictured as the man
fighting against the brute, slight, but active and noble in build, facing
this burly foe.</p>

<p>And poor old Turkey! Always a figure of comedy, never ready in
time, always ineffective, never fully able to use the weapons of so-called
“civilisation.” Let it a ways be remembered that in the Gallipoli
peninsula, when the Turks at first were taking no prisoners, but killing
the wounded after their own familiar fashion with mutilation, for the
sake of such spoil as could be carried away, Enver Pasha issued an
order that thirty piastres should be paid for every prisoner brought
in alive, a noble and humane regulation. Let us hope that the reward
was always paid, not stolen on the way, as has been so often the case
in Turkey.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Many</span> a stout-hearted man can “bite upon the bullet” and
bear pain up to the varying but inevitable limit when unconsciousness
puts an end to literally unbearable agony. But is there
anyone who could face with any show of courage the unutterable
terror of slow asphyxiation? This is indeed a horrible picture.
Raemaekers has helped us to realise the unrealisable, setting down
with his swift and merciless pencil the oft-repeated incident of the
despair, even to tears, of surgeons and nurses who, God knows, might
well have thought they had little to learn about human suffering.</p>

<p>The German will blush for this devilry till the last day of history.
One other deed of his was near as bad—the attempt to fasten on the
French the guilt of this infamous departure from the laws of chivalry
in war. One other deed was worse—that of the Prussian officer
prisoner who, as reported by our “Eye-witness,” saw some of our
men writhing on the ground in the throes of this agony and—laughed.</p>

<p>This bad business of the poison-gas was a damnable crime and a
short-sighted. It tempered the fighting resolution of our men. Ask
in particular any Canadian since Ypres, and certainly after and because
of that day many a German in the field has received a bayonet wound
instead of quarter and a kindly cigarette. It is for Germans after
repentance to ask themselves whether after all such initiative has
really any military value—except to the other side.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> you don’t see what you want, pay for it, is Germany’s motto
to-day. A veritable rain of German gold has fallen in all the neutral
countries during the war. Italy, Roumania, Greece, Spain, Holland,
Switzerland, and Scandinavia have had the tares of German secret
funds sown amongst the wheat of genuine public opinion. It was
Bismarck’s belief that by gold all newspapers and most men are to
be bought.</p>

<p>To-day it is hard to make any German bureaucrat believe that
it is not possible to make neutrals think black is white if only
enough money be spent. The fact that German black is very very
black does not deter the industrious secret fund distributors. Newspapers
are bought, agitators are subsidised, a false public opinion is
artificially created—and the principal end is always to help those
who made the war in Germany and those who keep it going to calm
the masses in repeating what neutral papers and neutral led
captains say.</p>

<p>A nation which has to depend upon such means of drugging itself
into acquiescence has little to hope for. In Italy, in Roumania, the
scattering of German gold has availed nothing—but while there remains
a neutral State there will German secret funds be scattered. And
with it all, the bellowing, blustering German propagandist, thumping
any neutral table and endeavouring to make people believe that all
men are as he is, knows well that he only gets a hearing, even from
the lowest elements of any nation, because behind him is his colleague
with the money-bag—Raemaekers has expressed in the money-bag
holder all the true inwardness of the German system of propaganda.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“When</span> the tiger,” says the naturalist, “has killed some large
animal, such as a buffalo which he cannot consume at one
time, the jackals collect round the carcase at a respectful distance and
wait patiently until the tiger moves off. Then they rush from all
directions, carousing upon the slaughtered buffalo, each anxious to
eat as much as it can contain in the shortest time.”</p>

<p>The human jackal is one of the most squalid and sordid creatures
and features of war. We saw him in Dublin the other day emerging
from his slum den to loot Sackville Street. Every battlefield feeds its
carrion beasts and birds.</p>

<p>This picture of Belgium and its jackals is doubtless only too true.
Mr. Raemaekers and the Dutch have better means of knowing than we.
The jackal, says the same naturalist, belongs to the <i lang="la">Canidæ</i>, the
“dog tribe.” The scientific name of the true dog is <i lang="la">Canis familiaris</i>,
“the household dog.” The jackal is <i lang="la">Canis aureus</i>, the “gold dog.”
The epithet describes no doubt his colour. The human <i lang="la">Canis aureus</i>
perhaps deserves his title on not less obvious grounds.</p>

<p>“The continent of Europe,” the naturalist goes on, “is free from
the jackal.” It was supposed till yesterday to be free from the lion
and tiger.</p>

<p>But in the prehistoric times of the cave man, geologists say, there
was both in England and Europe the great “sabre-tooth” tiger.
Kipling, who knows everything about beasts, knows him and puts
him into his “Story of Ung”: “The sabre-tooth tiger dragging a
man to his lair.”</p>

<p>To-day the cave tiger has come back and with him the cave jackal.
There is a terrible beauty about the tiger. The jackal is a mean and
hideous brute. But both are out of date. Did not Monsieur Capus
say the other day that Europe “cannot allow a return of the cave
epoch”?</p>

<p>How any human being can support the thought of the woeful red
horror into which he, deliberately, and of long-planned evil intention,
plunged the world passes the possibilities of human comprehension.</p>

<p>Deliberately, cold-bloodedly, for the simple purpose of furthering
his own ends, he has ordered the massacre of women and children in
untold multitudes, and his orders have been executed by the tools he
fashioned in the years of treacherous peace for the purpose. Executed
too by fiends in human shape who were forced to do as they were
ordered or take the consequences. Fathers of families themselves in
many cases no doubt, it is one of the marvels of this new savagery
that men, so calling themselves, could be found to do such deeds.
Many of them have gone to their account. The arch-fiend still survives.</p>

<p>And this man calls upon God to bless his evil doings!</p>

<p>“Suffer the little ones to come unto Me!” said Christ. And His
wounded heart must bleed afresh at knowledge of it all.</p>

<p>There was massacre of the innocents in Judea when Herod thought
to save himself by slaying the infant Christ with all the other children.
But Christ lived. The Kaiser out-Herods Herod, and slays Christ
afresh in the murder of all these little ones.</p>

<p>They are pitiful sacrifices to the blood-lust of this modern Moloch.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> unerring insight to motive which characterises Raemaekers’
work is well displayed in this cartoon, in which is shown
not only the German fury against England, but the senselessness
of that fury. The raging, soulless hate depicted here is
the hate that takes no count of the lives of women and children,
but would sacrifice these and all else to its own ends. The crime
is one that will live in men’s memories while recollection of this
war endures, and will be placed at the head of that long list of
acts which can have no possible effect on the result of the war,
and, in fact, can have no result at all beyond showing the guiding
spirit of Germany as Raemaekers shows it—ugly, mad, and a thing
worthy only of destruction at the hands of sane civilisation.</p>

<p>In the rush of events we are in danger, not of forgetfulness,
but of neglect of comprehension of the spirit prompting acts like
the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, for the stern purpose of these times is
all-absorbing, and material urgencies must, for the time, stand
before the reckoning out of a rate of payment for such deeds
as this. But in the day of the great reckoning it would be
well if this cartoon could be kept full in sight of the reckoners;
not for mere vengeance, for that would not bring back those
who went down with the <i>Lusitania</i>, or fell under bombs dropped
aimlessly or with intent to terrorise—and, in any case, humanity
could never exact full vengeance for such acts as these, nor is
such a figure as this true presentation of Germany of to-day
capable of feeling human vengeance. For the sake of future
generations, for the safety of humanity and that civilisation as we
know it may endure, the reckoning must include the extinction of
this spirit which Raemaekers shows as that of a raging and senseless
slaughterer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this cartoon Raemaekers has contrived to indicate powerfully
what is after all the dominant and peculiar note of the German
people. No European nation has ever taken war—as people say—so
“seriously,” that is, with so much concentration of attention and
elaborate preparation, as has the German Empire. No people has ever
had it so thoroughly drilled into its collective mind as have the German
subjects of that Empire that war is not only, as all Christian people
have always believed, an expedient lawful and necessary upon occasion,
but a thing highly desirable in itself, nay, the principal function of a
“superior” race and the main end of its being.</p>

<p>And yet after all the actual German is never, like the Frenchman,
a natural and instinctive warrior—any more than he is, like the
Englishman, a natural and instinctive adventurer. The whole business
of Prussian militarism, with the half-witted philosophy by which it
is justified, has to be imposed upon him from without by his masters.
He fights just as he works, just as he tortures, violates and murders,
because he is told to do so by persons in a superior position, holding
themselves stiffly, dressed in uniform, and able to hit him in the
face with a whip.</p>

<p>Long before the war the absurd Koepenick incident gave us a glimpse
of this astonishing docility on its farcical side. Its tragic side is
well illustrated by the droves of helpless and inarticulate barbarians
driven into the shambles daily (as at Verdun) for the sole purpose of
covering up the blunders of their very “efficient” superiors. One
could pity the wretches if there were not so considerable a leaven
of wickedness in their stupidity.</p>

but the reverse of the Prussian shield. As to the Pacifist all
war is crime, so to the Prussian all crime is legitimate war. In the
sublime resistance of the soldier who defends his country, its women
and its children, even to the spilling of his soul, the Pacifist will see
nothing but the crime of murder; and to the Prussian the act of war is
mainly the perpetration of crime unhindered, from common lying to
murder most foul, and beyond that. These crimes the Pacifist palliates
and condones, with his Fellowships of Reconciliation and his schools for
the Conscientious Liar; while the Prussian celebrates them as victories.</p>

<p>The wilful destruction of works of art as an act of war is a crime
unknown among civilised peoples; and if there be degrees in that crime
the destruction of such a work as Rheims Cathedral—the pious labour
of a colony of artists directed to one end for seven generations—is
surely the most monstrous. At Rheims, at Louvain, at Ypres, at a
dozen places this spite of the grinning <em>crétin</em> has been manifested;
and perhaps after all we were never justified in our amazement.
Dull savages do such things in mere incomprehension; and mere
incomprehension before a work of art is Prussian nature. The best
Prussian use of such a work is to build upon it some irrelevant statistic,
some ludicrous <i lang="de">polemik</i>, some laborious medley of meaningless side-issue.</p>

<p>Let one thing be borne in mind, however, against the settlement to
be made at the end of this war. It is against the policy of civilised
peoples to trust savages with the possession either of works of art or
weapons of precision.</p>

fierce, unless hunger intervene, and then the cattle may become, not
skittish, but fierce, and even furious. Are the cattle and the corn
once again made to speak a language not their own?</p>

<p>Depicted is an incident of this revealing bloody time. The Austrian
Francis Joseph has been brought into subjection by Wilhelm of Potsdam,
second of that name overlord of Germany. But, you say, Wilhelm is
not overlord of Francis Joseph of Schönbrunn! Facts are as they are.
Do you see that spiked helmet crowning the head of intolerance, moustache
challenging heaven, and outstretched finger dropping ultimata!
The earth is the Kaiser’s, and the cattle thereof. “If you won’t let me
have your corn, I will not let you have my cattle”—though the cattle
came from Denmark they are “my cattle.” True, there is the other
“Kaiser” opposite; but that is another story. We are told it is
risky work going hunting with a tiger; and methinks aged Francis
Joseph will confess that it is even so. His grey hairs have not saved
him personally, his “ramshackle Empire” has been, time and again,
over-run, his territory has been offered as sops by his younger brother
and master of Potsdam. The only wonder in the legend below is
“your corn”; above the artist depicts a raging tyrant whose is all,
to dispose as the laws of Kultur may please.</p>

<p>Honour among thieves! That is only when they are in the retail
trade. The appetite grows as it is fed, and masterly never becomes
master-ful. Austria-Hungary is reputed already as satiated with
war’s losses, not repentant, and her people in dire need. But her partner
in iniquity is a master: and Austria’s need is an opportunity to bargain,
and to make subject; hence the shrinking, cringing Hapsburg before
the challenging moustache, strident voice, accusing finger of young
Hohenzollern, lean and worn! Before the world, here is the fact,
these Kaisers, like foot-pads quarrelling—and there are the two privates,
so lean and abject, while the “swag” is in question.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> manipulation of the Press is one of the weapons which
Bismarck taught German Imperialism to use. Like others it
has been developed by his successors into an instrument which the
master himself would hardly have recognised. It is one of the most
potent means of that “peaceful penetration” of all other countries
which was nothing but a preparation for war. And it has been used
in the war with a purposefulness of aim and a versatility of method
that betoken long and systematic study. It is a ubiquitous influence
and the most subtle of all. Yet the Press is held in greater contempt
by official and other ruling circles in Germany than in any other country.
They despise the tool, while tacitly acknowledging its utility by
unsparing use.</p>

<p>This curious state of things is the fault of the Press. What has
rendered it such a pliant tool in the hands of German Imperialism
is either credulity or venality; and both are contemptible qualities.
Credulity is probably the more prevalent, at least in this country,
where shoals of newspapers, blinded by their own prejudices, were the
dupes of German duplicity. But there has been venality, too, both
crude and subtle. The case of the “Vlaamsche Stem,” here satirised
by Raemaekers, is exceptional. So crude and gross a method of
influencing the Press as bribing the proprietor of a newspaper (probably
with the aid of threats) to hand it over with its staff and good-will
could hardly be practised where any independence survived. It
was not practised with success even in conquered Flanders, for the
staff, to their eternal credit, refused to listen to the new master’s voice.
But there are journalists who, less intelligent than the terrier, faithfully
accept the voice from the <i lang="de">Pickelhaube</i> and wag their little tails when
they hear it. To them is offered the parable which shows their relation
to their master.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> All-Highest, so we are told, loves a joke at another’s expense,
a trait in his character essentially barbaric. Raemaekers
reproduces the twinkle in the Imperial eye as William of Potsdam
offers to a quondam ally the foot which belongs to his senile and helpless
brother of Hapsburg. The roar of anguish from the prostrate
octogenarian provokes, as we see, not pity but a grim smile. Italy’s
monarch, we may imagine, is muttering to <span class="locked">himself:—</span></p>

<p class="right">
<i lang="la">Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</i>
</p>

<p>The bribe, wrenched from another, was, of course, indignantly rejected,
but one wonders what the secret feelings of the Hapsburgs
may be towards the Hohenzollerns. We know that the Turk cherishes
no love for the Hun who has beguiled him, but we cannot gauge as yet
the real strength or weakness of the bond between the Huns on the one
hand and the Austrians and Hungarians on the other. Raemaekers
has pourtrayed Franz Josef flat on his back. In the language of the
ring he is “down and out.” Possibly it may have been so from the
beginning. At any rate, in this country, there is an amiable disposition
to regard Franz Josef as a victim rather than an accomplice,
a weakling writhing beneath the jack-boot of Prussia, impotent to
hold his own. It may not be so. Time alone will reveal the truth.</p>

<p>But this much is reasonably certain. When peace is declared, the
sincere friendship which once existed between ourselves and the Dual
Monarchy may be re-established, but many years must pass before we
forgive or forget the Huns. They are boasting to-day that as a nation
they are self-sufficing and self-supporting. Amen! Most of us desire
nothing better than to leave them alone till they have mended their
manners and purged themselves of a colossal and unendurable conceit.
I cannot envisage Huns playing tennis at Wimbledon, or English
girls studying music at Leipzig. The grass in the streets of Homburg
will not, for many years, be trodden out by English feet; the harpies
of hotel keepers throughout the Happy Fatherland will prey, it may
be presumed, upon their fellow Huns. Then they will fall to “strafing”
each other instead of England. And then, as now, their mouthings will
provoke inextinguishable laughter.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Ever</span> since with the beginning of Christendom a new soul
entered the body of exhausted Europe, it is true to say that we
have not only had a certain idea but been haunted by it, as by a ghost.
It is the idea crystallised in legends like those of St. Christopher and
St. Martin. But it is equally apparent in the most modern ethics and
eloquence, as, for instance, when a French atheist orator urged the
reconsideration of a criminal case by pointing at the pictured Crucifixion
which hangs in a French Law Court and saying: “Voilà la
chose jugée.” It is the idea that when oppressing the lowest we may
actually be oppressing the highest, and that not even impersonally,
but personally. We may be, as it were, the victims of a divine masquerade;
and discover that the greatest of kings can travel incognito.</p>

<p>Such a picture, therefore, as the cartoonist has drawn here can be
found in all ages of Christian history as a comment on contemporary
oppression. But while the central figure remains always the same, the
types of the tyrant and the mocker hold our temporary attention; for
they are sketched from life and with a living exactitude. Upon one of
them especially it would be easy to say a great deal; the grinning
Prussian youth with the spectacles and the monkey face, who is using a
Prussian helmet instead of the crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Such a scientific gutter-snipe is the real and visible fruit of organised
German education; he is a much truer type than any gory and hairy
Hun. In the face of that young atheist there is everything that can
come from the congestion of the pagan with the <i lang="fr">parvenu</i>; all the
knowingness that is the cessation of knowledge; and that something
which always accompanies <em>real</em> atheism—arrested development.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A large</span> number of the Belgians are said to have been in German
pay, and their support contributed to put the country helpless
under German power. Does this cartoon show Belgians of that class,
or only the ordinary selfish and pleasure-seeking element of society,
too weak to be even worth purchase by the enemy? The scene is a
café at The Hague. In the background the band is making music with
all its heart and all its power. Two Belgians going out enveloped in
greatcoats with capes to face the stormy weather stop for a moment
to speak to an acquaintance, one of a party who are enjoying themselves
at ease. They are joining the army.</p>

<p>The party is evidently not interested in such a trifle as their country
and its fate: they are well out of Belgium, which must be an
uncomfortable place to live in at present, and they are not going
back till Belgium is a fit home for the butterflies of fashion. The fifth
of the party, down in the right-hand corner, has the vacuous face of
an imbecile. Two of the others wear a foolish grin, as the word
passes between one of them, a lady, and the more capable-looking
man seated next her: “Fancy, they’re off to fight.” What fools to
think of duty and country, when it means leaving comfort and the life
of society, and facing the storm, with the risk of death!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Whether</span> the artist’s eye be turned to Germany or to Holland,
he gives proof that his vision is clear and his sense of propriety
and humour keen. But the “new oil line” is Dutch, and here
the humour is more genial, the satire less sharp and biting. In the
foreground, drawn with great force and dignity, is the Lion of England,
in blandest mood, who with his back to the German, astride the cask
in strikingly complacent smiles, holds the dish to the tap in England,
pouring out oil which is carried by an ingenious use of the Lion’s tail
to the German’s cask. Over the great Lion, and held by the Lion, is
the umbrella, inscribed N.O.T. [the Netherlands Oversea Trust], under
cover of which the oil is thus cleverly carried to the smiling German.
The artist touches safely and surely a delicate subject which a journalist
could not treat without rousing anger; but in result a situation is shown
which is sure to prove, and is proving, a trying one both to the Dutch
and to the British people. However, there can be little question but
that the edge of his wit is turned upon his “ain countrie” by this
formidable artist-commentator.</p>

<p>The cunning and brutality of a German debased by the worship of
Kultur, of force, are almost wholly absent here; and instead the artist
treats the question of Neutrality, and smiles in line and colour at both
Holland and Britain. Poor “human nature” is held up to the mirror;
foibles, failings, and futility reflected. That the Lion should think
that N.O.T. umbrella shelters him from trickery only shows his vanity:
that the oil goes to the “enemy” shows the artist’s views of some
Dutchmen; that N.O.T. may also suggest that the German’s need is
supplied even by the Lion’s tail of pride. Is there a further satire of
men in war? While men are mown down on the field by death’s
improved tools, some men will always find it “good business” to deal in
“oil,” or something else at the expense of a belligerent. If the Dutchman
does the business, and the German, broadly pleased, has his sore
need supplied, there is the generous Lion, ’neath an umbrella which
he upholds himself, made to oil an enemy, the German of the age of
Kultur! <i lang="la">Canto virginibus puerisque.</i></p>

respectively. The one bird is as useless as the other in bringing the war
to the end desired in Berlin. The stage eagle is daily losing its plumage,
and is rapidly becoming but a moulty apology for the king of birds.
As for the dove, it has been used so often, with constantly changing
olive branch in its beak, that it now makes its appearance shamefacedly
and absolutely without heart.</p>

<p>Imperial eagle mask with half-mad military quasi-deity inside and
dove of peace, on the German model, with calculating miscalculating
statesman, you rang the curtain up, you cannot ring it down, either
to the music of the Hymn of Hate or the Te Deum for peace—the
eagle can no longer look boldly straight into the sun, looking for his
place in it; the dove has taken permanent quarters in the German ark
as it whirls round and round in the whirlpool of impotent effort, ever
drawing nearer to the final crash. When the Dove of Peace does
come, it will be a real bird of good omen, not a German reserve

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> picture is a perfectly accurate symbolic study of the German
Empire. Therefore, naturally, it is one of the most dreadful that
were ever drawn. In all the gruesome “Dances of Death” in which the
fifteenth century took so grim a pleasure, no artist ever conceived the
horrible idea of a fat skeleton. But we have not only conceived the
thought, we have seen the thing—“a terror in the sunshine.” We
know that chest, puffed up with a wind of pride, and that stomach
heavy with slaughter and rich living; and above them the Death’s
Head. We have seen it. We have felt its foul breath. Its name is
Prussia.</p>

<p>Look at a portrait of Frederick the Great, the “onlie true begetter”
of this abortion. It oddly suggests what Raemaekers has set down
here; the face a skull, the staring eyes those of a lost soul. But the
skeleton has grown fat since Frederick’s day—fat on the blood and
plunder of nations. Only there is no living flesh on its bones, nothing
of humanity about it.</p>

<p>“Can these dry bones live?” was the question asked of the prophet.
It might have been asked of Frederick: “Can this nation live, created
of your foul witchcraft, without honour, without charity, without
human brotherhood or fellowship, without all that which is the flesh
and blood of mankind?” The answer must have been that it could
live, though with a life coming from below and essentially infernal.
It could live—for a time. It could even have great power because its
time was short.</p>

<p>But now it has waxed fat—and kicked. And its end is near.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the picture opposite the best elements of the great cartoonist’s
genius have full scope. One has the biting satire, the humour and
the extraordinary gift of representing facial expressions with an economy
of line reminding one of some of the best work of the late Phil May,
that prince of humorous British caricaturists.</p>

<p>Raemaekers does not spare even his own countrymen when he
discovers a situation inimical to the welfare of the Allied cause, or one
which involves an obvious absurdity.</p>

<p>Here we have such a situation. In the early days of the War of
far greater frequency than at present, thanks to the ever tightening
“strangle hold” of the British Fleet. There can be no doubt that
for many months Holland (greatly to her material gain) turned herself
into a conduit pipe for the supply of contraband of War to the Central
Empires and more especially to Germany. Daily there were scenes
such as that depicted, though possibly veiled with some thin veneer
either of legality or subterfuge.</p>

<p>Dutch peasants (as well as the agents of the rich merchants and
the resident German smugglers) of all ages and grades flocked to the
frontier figuratively if not literally to drop their bags of contraband
over the slenderly marked line which divides Holland from Germany.</p>

<p>On the faces of the smugglers one sees the grin of satisfaction and
the smug recognition of the truth of the ancient saw, “It’s an ill wind
that blows nobody any good.” They are all doing their little bit—though
strictly neutral, of course—to keep the Huns alive, to provide
the means of killing the soldiers of the Allies, and—at the same time
are adding to that “nest egg” which is so dear to the Dutch heart.</p>

<p>At the frontier line are two soldiers. The Dutch guard with a stolid
appearance in his back, and with a look of detachment and bland unconsciousness
of what is going on behind it, discoverable even on the small
portion of his face that is visible. On the other side of the frontier
stands the Hun guard smiling sardonically at the Dutch ideas of
neutrality, and the eagerness with which the people of the land he
covets, and hoped to take, play his game.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this cartoon the Dutch artist pays a high compliment to the
British working man. The hideous figure of Alcoholism dressed
in rags, with large bony hands at the end of her thin bony arms, with
the glaring eyes, the distorted face and the dishevelled hair of a raging
mad woman, approaches the workman, offering bottles of whisky
which he has struck from her hand. Two of them lie smashed on the
ground, the third is falling. The workman’s choice is made voluntarily.
He will be neither the slave of drink, on the one hand, nor the slave of
prohibitory law on the other. He will judge for himself, and his
decision is expressed in this cartoon. He knows the nature of
Alcoholism which assails him, and he looks at her with anger and
contempt as he points to the answer which he has expressed in the
bottles falling or broken.</p>

<p>It contains also the answer which this artist of a foreign and neutral
country makes to the charges of drunkenness that were a year ago
hurled against the British workman. He was said to be endangering
the country by his self-indulgence. While there are exceptions,
unfortunately, to the picture that Raemaekers here shows us, there
need be no hesitation in believing that the workman’s attitude, as
the artist sees it, is the attitude of the overwhelming majority. It
is not often that a higher compliment has been paid to the workman
than in this cartoon. It is the ideal truth; and the more widely it
is seen and appreciated, the more it will make the ideal into the actual
truth. It does not enter into the artist’s purpose to show the serious
loss caused by the alcoholism of even a small minority, but this point
of view must not be forgotten in real life.</p>

<p>Copies of this cartoon should be widely spread through the country.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A German</span> business firm never lets go of a customer once it seizes
him. Of course that is an extreme statement, for customers
die or change their country, or even revolt against the importunities
of the German bagman. Still, it may be taken as a fact that Germany
exhibits a pertinacity in trade that rivals her pertinacity in war.</p>

<p>Now Foreign Trade in the conception of Germany does not mean,
though it includes, the selling of goods; it means the destruction of
all other than German interests. Politics and economics are convertible
terms in the mind of the Fatherland. To absorb and make
German the world—that is the idea woven in invisible thread in the
fabrics she sells, written in invisible ink in her contracts, stamped in
invisible letters on her metal goods.</p>

<p>Before the war she was fast reducing great free nations to economic
serfdom, so that to buy a rat-trap they had to turn to Germany, who
sold them, with a certain grim humour, even the very guns to fight
her in, what she considered to be, an already won war.</p>

<p>She paralysed England, Russia, and France economically and
politically, just as a snake paralyses its victims, and she was about
to swallow them one after the other, and would have swallowed them

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I remember</span> very early in the war a distinguished neutral saying to
me: “Germany hopes for swift and wide conquests, not so much that
she believes that she can retain all she seizes as that she hopes in the
end to have much to bargain with. Her policy, should she fail in her
world conquest, will be analogous to that of a thief who seeks to purchase
liberty and immunity from punishment for a crime with the money
he has stolen.” It is an aspect of Germany’s policy that will repay
watching. When peace terms come to be discussed, the Allies must
not accept stolen goods even in part settlement for German crimes
and aggression.</p>

<p>Raemaekers here suggests, what has been present in many other
minds, the idea that the capture of Dutch ships was stage-managed
to enable the new Ambassador at The Hague to “create a good impression”
in his favour by a release of the ships.</p>

<p>The action may have impressed shipping circles, and have avoided
“strained relations” between the two Governments of The Hague
and of Berlin; but the Dutch must indeed be a simple folk and blind
if they did not on this occasion “look the gift horse in the mouth”
with a view to ascertaining its exact value.</p>

<p>To clumsy diplomacy Germany has more than once added a lack
of humour of an astonishing degree of obtuseness in dealing with
neutral nations, of which this incident of the Dutch ships is an excellent
example.</p>

<p class="drop-cap r"><span class="smcap1">Raemaekers’</span> terrible picture represents a scene of frequent
occurrence in Belgium during the earlier months of the
war. The tragedy depicted requires no comment; it is sufficiently
explicit in the cynical smile of the German soldier, the agony of the
Belgian mother, and the heap of corpses before her amongst which she
is to find her son.</p>

<p>German military ethics have been the wonder and the detestation
of the whole world. But they have been practised and carried out
by the present army in accordance with principles laid down long ago
by German military writers, especially by Clausewitz. It was Clausewitz
above all who enunciated the axiom that in times of war every
elementary consideration of humanity must be postponed in pursuit
of victory. Prince Bismarck adopted the doctrines of Clausewitz
and often blamed the German soldiers for the leniency with which
they at times treated the French in the war of 1870. It was not enough,
so Bismarck thought, to slay the actual combatants. “It will come
to this,” he said, “that we will shoot down every male inhabitant.”</p>

<p>It is especially interesting to see what attitude the Teuton savages
assumed towards the efforts of those who were anxious to mitigate
the horrors of war. In a handbook published in 1902 by the German
General Staff, we observe the ruthless effrontery with which all the
efforts of the men who negotiated The Hague, Geneva and Brussels
conventions were swept away. It was laid down with absolute frankness
that “German military authorities do not recognise the validity
of any international conventions dealing with the laws of war.”</p>

<p>Thus the scenes which have so shocked us in the present campaign
are not inconsistent with, are, indeed, the logical outcome of, principles
long since accepted by Berlin. War must be carried to its extreme,
even against a peaceful population, because in this way the strongest
inducements will be brought to bear upon them to admit conquest
and therefore to accept the ultimate conclusion of peace. We know
from recent reports of the French Government and other authorities
that the murder of prisoners and wounded men has been of frequent
occurrence, and that not once but many times orders have been issued
to give no quarter. Hostages, also, have been terrorised. Taken in
order to serve as securities for the good conduct of the civil population,
they have not only been put in the forefront of danger but frequently
killed in order to execute the decrees of “Terrorism.”</p>

<p>What in point of fact is the German idea of waging war? Inasmuch
as the duty of a nation at war is to conquer, all measures, however
indefensible in time of peace, are justified. Moreover, if any engagements
have been entered into during the pre-war period, they become
cancelled when war has begun.</p>

<p>Is it not absolutely necessary that a nation which adopts, principles
like these should be so weakened in military strength as to render it
impotent for mischief for at least half a century?</p>

<p class="drop-cap r"><span class="smcap1">Raemaekers</span> knows far more about the real feelings of
his own countrymen than a foreigner can do. We have seen
that the Dutch people are full of sympathy for the Belgian refugees, and
that they have helped them with great generosity. English fugitives
from the war zone have also been kindly treated in Holland. But
from what I have heard myself, I fear that there are many Dutchmen
who do not realise that the existence of their country as an independent
nation is bound up with the success of the Allies.</p>

<p>All the corrupt and malign influences which Germany has been
sedulously and treacherously exercising in neutral countries have been
exerted in their worst forms in Holland. The country is honeycombed
with German intrigues, and half-strangled in a network of commercial
interests and obligations. The Press is practically not free, and a
numbing sense of terror is spread over the population.</p>

<p>In the long run the fate of Belgium, terrible as it has been, may
be preferable to that of Holland, unless the countrymen of De
Reuter and Van Tromp have the resolution to strike a blow for
their honour and freedom, while there is yet time. They are in
danger of becoming the vassals of a Power which has no more
sympathy with the ideals of a free commonwealth than Philip II.,
and which has shown that it can surpass the Duke of Alva in cruelty.</p>

<p>The Huns pay the price of lies by being constrained “to lie on
still.” But, sooner or later—sooner, perhaps, than they think—their
lies will come home to roost. The great gullible Hun public,
the slaves of an iron discipline, will learn the truth. No people in the
history of the world has been so consummately befooled, so systematically
humbugged. One wonders what the awakening will be like?
The army, if we may credit the testimony of some prisoners, is just
beginning to ask questions; the women of Hunland are on the ragged
edge of revolt. The Junkers, it is true, sit heavily upon public opinion,
the safety-valve of every nation. Meanwhile, hidden forces are
accumulating strength. A cataclysmic explosion must take place. And
then the savage instincts of the great blonde beast, instincts fostered

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Louis Raemakers</span> knows his own countrymen better than
we can, and this satire at the expense of the peace at any price
brigade is doubtless well deserved. The attitude might have been
pardoned two years ago, but it is merely insane to-day. And none
knows that fact better than Holland. Like America, she is taking
care of herself; indeed, no nation has better reason to do so with a
neighbour at her elbow unamenable to reason and uncontrolled by
conscience.</p>

<p>Historians to come, however, will argue that our blindness was
unpardonable, and our surprise and unpreparedness before the advent
of war must cast a heavy slur on the future credit of our past diplomacy.
For what could be clearer than Germany’s attitude or brighter than
the beacons which had directed and were still directing her course?
Bernhardi tells us all there is to know; Frederick the Great established
the Prussian tradition on a basis of fraud and force; Bismarck sustained
it and William II. has striven to reap the harvest of their sowing. It
has needed the united might of Europe to prevent him from doing so.
But to cry out against Teutonic principle and practice, as though it
were a thing of yesterday sprung upon us in these wars, is absurd.
Every politician worthy the name had the pages of history open for
his perusal. Frederick pointed out that alliances in which each contracting
party has different interests must never hold good under
all conditions, or represent a permanent political system. He
declared that no alliance or agreement in the world can be effective
after the bond of common and reciprocal interest is broken.</p>

<p>Why then marvel at the Belgian “Scrap of paper,” or any number
of them? It was a political commonplace with the German Chancellor
and his Master that oaths should be broken at the moment it became
inconvenient to keep them. Bernhardi himself says that political
agreements must always be concluded with a tacit reservation and can
only hold as long as the interests of both contracting parties are satisfied.</p>

<p>“La guerre,” said Mirabeau, “est l’industrie nationale de la Prusse.”
She came into existence by that industry and no other; and until
civilisation can crush that industry, peace terms with Prussia must
not depend upon her promise to fulfil them but upon our power to
make her do so. To cry “Down with militarism!” therefore is emphatically
to play the German game, and she will always support that
cry in other mouths, just as she applauds our “Free Trade” and other
traditions that have played into her hands so long.</p>

<p>Holland at least is alive to danger, and since the artist drew this
picture we have learned by <i lang="fr">communiqué</i> from Dutch General Headquarters
that the army is equipped in every possible respect, and able
to face the prospect of war with confidence. The nation as a whole
has supported Parliament with enthusiasm, and the preparations have
been directed and inspired by the spectacle of modern warfare and its
highest needs.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“Here</span> I and sorrows sit. This is my throne, bid Kings
come worship it.” Such seems to be an appropriate legend
for Raemaekers’ beautiful triptych which he has entitled “Our
Lady of Antwerp.” Full of compassion and sympathy for all the
sufferings of her people, she sits with the Cathedral outlined behind
her, her heart pierced with many agonies. On the left is one of the
many widows who have lost their all in this war. On the right is a
soldier stricken to death, who has done his utmost service for his
country and brings the record of his gallantry to the feet of Our Lady
of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Antwerp, as we know, was at the height of its prosperity in the
sixteenth century. We have been told that no fewer than five hundred
ships used to enter her port in the course of a day, while more than
two thousand could be seen lying in her harbour at one time. Her
people numbered as many as one million, her fairs attracted
merchants from all parts of Europe, and at least five hundred million
guilders were put into circulation every year. We know what followed.
Its very prosperity proved a bait to the conqueror. In 1576 the city
was captured by the Spaniards, who pillaged it for three days. Nine
years later the Duke of Parma conquered it, and about the time when
Queen Elizabeth was resisting the might of Spain Antwerp’s glory
had departed and its trade was ruined. At the close of the Napoleonic
wars the city was handed over to the Belgians.</p>

<p>A place of many memories, whose geographical position was well
calculated to arouse the cupidity of the Germans, was bound to be gallantly
defended by the little nation to which it now belonged. Whether
earlier help by the British might or might not have altered the course
of history we cannot tell. Perhaps it was not soon enough realised
how important it was to keep the Hun invader from the sacred soil.
At all events we do not look back on the British Expedition in aid of
Antwerp in 1914 with any satisfaction, because the assistance rendered
was either not ample enough or else it was belated, or both. So that Our
Lady of Antwerp has still to bewail the ruthless tyranny of Berlin, though
perhaps she looks forward to the time when, once more in possession
of her own cities, Belgium may enter upon a new course of prosperity.
We are pledged to restore Belgium, doubly and trebly pledged, by the
words of the Prime Minister, and justice will not be done until the
great act of liberation is accomplished.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Nothing</span>, when one analyses it, could be imagined more thoroughly
characteristic of Prussia than the particular stroke of policy
by which a large proportion of the male population of Belgium—as
also in a somewhat lesser degree of Northern France—was separated
from its family ties and hurried away into exile in Germany, there to
be compelled to work for the profit of enemies.</p>

<p>It had all the marks of Prussianism.</p>

<p>Firstly, it was a violation of the civilised and Christian tradition of
European arms. By the rules of such warfare the non-combatant
was spared, wherever possible; not only his life but his property and
liberty were secure so long as he did not abuse his position.</p>

<p>Secondly, it was an affront to decent human sentiment quite apart
from technical rules; the man, guilty of no offence save that of belonging
to a country which Prussia had invaded without justice and ravaged
without mercy, was torn from his family, who were left to the mercy
of their opponents. We all know what that mercy was like.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it was an insult to the human soul, for the unfortunate
victims were not only to be exiled from their country, but to be driven
by force and terror to serve against it.</p>

<p>Fourthly, and finally, like all the worst Prussian crimes, it was a
stupid blunder. Prussia has paid already a very high price for any
advantage she may have gained from the mutinous and unwilling
labour of these men, and for the swelling of her official return for the
edification of her own people and of neutrals by the inclusion of “prisoners
of war” of this description. To-day, when she knows not where
to turn for men, she is obliged to keep a huge garrison tied up in Belgium
to guard her line of retreat. And when the retreat itself comes,
the price will rise even higher, and the nemesis will be both just and
terrible.</p>

on them by one who is not fully conversant with the situation in
Holland is an impertinence, but in this case the artist’s satire is patent
to all. The contempt of the Queen at this bald rendering of Germany’s
many veiled offers is fully apparent; every line of the figure is expressive
of disdain, and the figure in the background appeals without result.</p>

<p>It is that figure in the background which has most interest, however;
it is yet another expression of the truth that these cartoons have made
so vividly evident, that Germany will stop short of nothing to gain
her ends. This envoy is the German as we knew him before the war,
deferent, somewhat waiter-ish, and at the same time suggestive of
the German commercial traveller—the very worst kind of commercial
traveller, for whom the word “business” covers such underhand
dealings as accompanied the furtherance of German plans in all countries—a
spy in disguise.</p>

<p>He says, in effect—“Yours is a very little country; in the day of
our world-dominance it will be well that you should have our protection.”

naval plans which dominance over Holland would give, and he offers

<p>“The warrior has need of passion. It must not, indeed, as the
result of opposition, be regarded as a necessary evil; nor condemned
as a regrettable consequence of physical contact; nor must we seek to
restrain and curb it as a savage and brutal force; for in causing a
powerful and exclusive concentration of individual energies it becomes
an indispensable agent of the consummation of conflict. Every warlike
exploit is before all things of a personal nature; it puts before all else
the affirmation of the individual character, and it demands, in its
agent, a release from the oppressive rule of the moderating laws of
everyday life.... <em>Violence</em> and <em>passion</em> are the two levers essential
to any warlike action, and, we say it advisedly, of all <em>military greatness</em>.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is when Germany’s absence of morals is most blatant that her
presence of mind comes to the rescue. It is a strange and wonderful
mind that she reveals—a weird combination of childishness without its
innocence, of wickedness without its cunning. Yet somehow the
German mental process is sometimes convincing. It is really one of
the wonders of the world that it should be so. When a country that
stole Silesia, Poland, Schleswig, Alsace-Loraine, Belgium and Serbia
solemnly assures a shocked and startled world that its life-long object
is to protect the freedom of small nationalities; when a Government,
that kills peaceful passengers by the hundred and torpedoes neutral
trading ships, says it does so in the cause of the freedom of the seas;
when a frenzied Emperor, foiled in the effort to conquer Europe by a
surprise attack, vows that his only purpose is self-defence, one would
think that such talk could deceive nobody—not even the speaker. A
child’s lie embarrasses but does not mislead its elders. Why, then,
does the German lie mislead? Or is it that the bully only seems to be
believed?</p>

<p>The feebler spirits of Holland would rather believe anything than
be forced into the turmoil of war. Germany, as a protector of the weak,
the champion of the small, they are willing to accept—rather than meet
Germany in arms. Nay, they—the descendants of the greatest seamen,
and to-day dependent on the sea for more than half the country’s
wealth—would prefer Germany’s guarantee of sea freedom than run
the risk of her land atrocities.</p>

<p>Raemaekers is the <i lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> of political argument. The German
contention is childish, the Dutch credulity is childish, and he meets them
with a child’s demonstration of what the truth would be. Three great
outlets of the sea are blocked by three brutal figures. We have only

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this cartoon Raemaekers endeavours to bring home to his compatriots
one lesson of the War. That as human nature now is—and
especially German in-human nature—the only guarantee, not
necessarily of peace but of life, for the smaller nations on the borders
of the German Empire is the provision of a force sufficient to give pause
to wanton aggression.</p>

<p>A large and more efficient Army might not have saved Belgium. It
would, however, possibly have diverted the German advance to another
quarter. It would undoubtedly have gained much valuable time for
the Allies in their fight for the cause of freedom and the preservation
of small nations.</p>

<p>Of the importance of a large and efficient Army to Holland at the
present juncture there can be no question. Germany in retreat may
invade the territory of the gallant little nation of free people, whose
history is a glorious and eloquent plea for their continued existence as
a separate nation, unless they are prepared to offer effective resistance.
Often the dying throes of a wild beast involve an unexpectedly wide
area in destruction. And if Germany wins, Holland may make up its
mind to becoming an appendage of the Hunnish Empire.</p>

<p>That this is realised by the more thoughtful and prescient Dutch
no one who knows them doubts; but the wave of prosperity in war
time which Holland has experienced may serve to dull the apprehension
of the less suspicious and far-sighted of her people.</p>

<p>With the case of the Belgian refugees before their eyes one may hope
that the lesson may strike home. Indeed, we cannot believe that the
wrongs of Belgium will be readily forgotten.</p>

<p>The central figure of the cartoon is not less eloquent because the
despair that is written upon the face is less emotional than that of the
girl and woman, or even the little boy. But it grips. Wisdom, too
often, alas! is purchased only with the bitter coin of experience.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Amongst</span> my most treasured possessions is a photograph taken
on board the lost <i>Invincible</i> after the battle of the Falkland Islands
was over. Three-quarters of a mile away <i>Inflexible</i> is silhouetted
against the evening sky, and between the two ships lies the flotsam
of the <i lang="de">Gneisenau</i>, with 200 or more German sailors clinging to wreckage
or swimming for their lives. A few steam pinnaces and cutters
are picking up these poor drowning fellows as fast as they can. The
fighting navy, having conquered its foe, is engaged upon the task,
always dear to it, of saving life. It is an added pleasure to befriend
those who have fought gallantly.</p>

<p>I do not know whether Raemaekers has ever seen this photograph,
but this drawing shows the drowning people, the wreckage, exactly
reproduced. But here the only boat has itself been smashed by a shot,
so that the last hope of safety of those in the water has been taken
from them. And the ship that sinks is not a fighting ship, and the poor
souls struggling for their lives are not fighting men. Can these men
in the foreground be the sailors of a fighting navy?</p>

<p>For the officer of this submarine is not content to warn the <i>Falaba</i>
and give its people a chance to save themselves before sinking her.
He has, indeed, warned her, but, with a refinement of cruelty, has
torpedoed the ship while the women and children were being hastily
got off; and, not content with this, has fired on and sunk the boats
in which his terrified victims hoped to escape.</p>

<p>There is here no artistic exaggeration. The picture is horrible just
because it is photographically accurate.</p>

<p>It is a hideous negation of all that the word “navy” has stood for
in every country that has ever possessed one. In nothing does
Raemaekers show his Dutch blood more than in his savage anger at
this gruesome perversion of the sea tradition. For the Dutch have a
great naval history and know the meaning of a seaman’s honour.</p>

<p>The true sailor is great in his bravery because he is still greater in
his chivalry. What will history say of these debauched brutes who
revel in their hangman’s task?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> this one picture is the whole story of German submarine war,
which heeds the presence of neither women nor children, but strikes
swiftly, secretly, and without giving its victim the opportunity of
defence. Not that in war it is demanded that the opponent should
be given chance of a fight on equal terms; for in sea war the whole
object of a naval commander is to concentrate an overwhelming
superiority of fire on his enemy, and to destroy.</p>

<p>It remained for Germany, however, to apply this doctrine of destruction
to mercantile craft and to neutral shipping, and to conduct war on
the principle that war justifies <em>any</em> means, any barbarity, even the
indiscriminate slaughter of non-combatants. This assassin striking
from behind has called the British blockade barbarous; but that
blockade at least gives the nation against whom it is exercised a choice
between evils, so much so in fact that all nations recognise it, and for
ages have recognised it, as part of the procedure of war—no accusation
of barbarity was made against Germany in 1871 for the starvation of
the civilian population of Paris. But this sea-murder is a different thing,
a thing that does not advance the end of the war, and a sign of a claim
on the part of its authors that civilisation cannot allow. It is as if they
questioned: “Since we have a certain power of destruction, shall we
not use it as pleases us?”</p>

<p>And the answer? There were, after the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
rows of bodies of women and children laid out for identification;
there were many other instances, almost equally tragic, and the answers
that they afford are eloquent enough. May they be well remembered
in the day of settlement.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Looking</span> at this cartoon one can understand why Raemaekers
is not <i lang="la">persona grata</i> in the Happy Fatherland. With half a dozen
touches he has changed Satan from the magnificent Prince of Evil
whom Gustave Doré portrayed into a—Hun. Henceforth we shall
envisage Satan as a Hun, talking the obscene tongue—now almost
the universal language in Hades—and hailed by right-thinking Huns
as the All Highest War Lord. Willy senior must be jealous.</p>

<p>With the learned Professor, the cartoonist not only produces a composite
portrait of all the <i lang="de">Herren Professoren</i>, but also drives home the point
of his amazing pencil into what is perhaps the most instructive lesson
of this monstrous war—the perversion to evil uses of powers originally
designed, nourished, and expanded to benefit mankind. When the
<i lang="de">Furor Teutonicus</i> has finally expended itself, we do not envy the feelings
of the illustrious chemists who perfected poison gas and liquid fire!
Will they, when their hour comes, find it easy to obey the poet’s injunction,
and, wrapping the mantle of their past about them, “lie down to
pleasant dreams”?</p>

<p>We are assured that these professors have not exhausted their powers
of frightfulness. It may be so. This is certain: Such frightfulness
will ultimately exhaust them. With this reflection, we may leave them,
grist to be ground by the mills of God.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Nothing</span> could be more thoroughly characteristic of the Prussian
mind than its utter misunderstanding of England. It exhibits all
the characteristics which we are accustomed to associate with “German
Thought,” and especially the combination of enormous industry in the
accumulation of facts with an utter inability to appreciate such facts
as cannot be catalogued and an amazing stupidity in passing judgment
even upon the facts which are recognised.</p>

<p>Thus, before the outbreak of war, the Prussians, knowing that we
were in the main a commercial people, immediately deduced the conclusion
that we should never fight for any other purpose than that
of making money. They found themselves in error. Similarly, after
our intervention, they looked up their documents and, discovering that
we had never had a very large army, concluded that we were not
to be reckoned with seriously in the field of military operations. Our
naval power they allowed for, for they could count the ships and had
them all duly docketed. But our army was “contemptible,” and
would certainly remain so.</p>

<p>That a nation, not originally military, could transform itself into a
nation in arms by the mere action of patriotic enthusiasm and anger
was a thing altogether undreamed of in the Prussian philosophy.
The revelation that the thing was so has produced first, incredulity,
and then a sort of bewilderment, as if all the foundations of “scientific
thought,” as the Germans understand it, had collapsed—as, indeed,
they had.</p>

<p>The thing that has not collapsed is the eternal strength which belongs
to a nation utterly convinced with the justice of its cause. The thing
is not possible to Prussians; but it is possible to Englishmen, as the
Prussians are already beginning to know.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> lecturer, with true German casuistry, minimises the rhinoceros
and magnifies the fly, so that there is “very little difference”
between them, as far as his arguments are concerned. Fortunately
for the cause of the Allies, casuistry is not a military asset; had it been
one, Germany would long since have won the war, and that not only on
this count, for the saying that “the wish is father to the thought” is
nowhere more true than in Germany.</p>

<p>There, the people are now firmly convinced that the war was forced
on them, thanks to the casuistry of their leaders; they honestly believe,
if professorial writings have any sincerity in them, that the invasion
of Belgium was justified by their need, and that scraps of paper are only
scraps of paper where they, the chosen nation for the spread of culture,
are concerned; they believe that Britain’s blockade is barbarous and
unjust, that France is an effete nation, that Russia is peopled by a horde
of savages, that the starvation of their civilian prisoners instead of
exchanging them is a just measure on their part—and many other things
which sane reasoning shows to be false. They have, apparently, an
endless credulity.</p>

<p>If one would question the cause for this, the answer lies in one word—“Pan-Germanism,”
that disease which has sapped away the moral fibre
of a nation and implanted colossal conceit in its place. No statement
is more true than that Germany is devoid of a sense of humour, for this
sense is in its essence that of proportion, and not only in her methods
of war and her dealings with the rest of the world has Germany lost all
sense of proportion, but also in her estimate of herself and her place in
the scheme of things. A proper sense of proportion is incompatible
with Pan-Germanism.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Since</span> the opening of hostilities in the present war the Scottish
regiments have given repeated proofs of a valour which adds new
lustre to the great traditions of Scottish soldiership. Through all the early
operations—on the retreat from Mons and at the battles of the Marne
and the Aisne—the Royal Scots Guards, the Scots Greys, the Gordon,
the Seaforth and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the King’s
Own Scottish Borderers gained many fresh laurels by their heroism
and undaunted spirit. The London Scottish Territorials, too, have
shown a prowess as signal as that of the Scots of the Regular Army;
while the mettle of men of Scottish descent has made glorious contribution
in France and elsewhere to the fine records of the Overseas armies.</p>

<p>It is the inevitable corollary that death should levy a heavy toll on
Scottish soldiers in the field. Thousands of kilted youth have suffered
the fate which Raemaekers depicts in the accompanying cartoon. It
is not, of course, only the young Scot whose thought turns in the moment
of death to the hearth of his home with vivid memories of his mother.
But the word “home” and all that the word connotes often makes a
more urgent appeal to the Scot abroad than to the man of another
nationality. There is significance in the fact that, far as the Scots are
wont to wander over the world’s surface, they should, under every sky
and in every turning fortune, treasure as a national anthem the song
which has the <span class="locked">refrain:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“For it’s hame, an’ it’s hame, fain wad I be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O! it’s hame, hame, hame, to my ain countrie!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The German soldier in this war would seem to have lost well nigh
all touch of humanity. Yet the draughtsman here suggests that even
the German soldier on occasion yields to the pathos of the young Scot’s
death-cry for home and mother. There is grim irony in the dying man’s
blurred vision, which mistakes the hand of his mortal foe for that of
his mother.</p>

<p>Of such trying scenes is the drama of war composed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">England</span> has without doubt been Germany’s favourite bug-a-boo
for the war. Once she threatened to exalt France to pride of place,
but her allegiance soon returned to John Bull, and she has left no trick
of hate untried to place him in the pillory before her own subjects and
neutral nations.</p>

<p>“Let shame,” said Herr Maximilian Harden, who, as a German-Jew,
may perhaps view the wider issues with some detachment and plead to
his adopted people for philosophy and self-control—“let shame spread
a thick veil over self-deification and enemy-bedevilment.” A futile
appeal must this be to a nation that knows no shame, from its Emperor
to his humblest slave. Self-deification is the marrow in German bones,
the oil in German joints; while as to bedevilment of the enemy, in this
they naturally excel, since supreme power of detraction is a complement
of envy and jealousy: the one involves the others.</p>

<p>Michael’s dummy “John Bull” was, however, very clearly made in
Germany, and Holland is not deceived. She adjoins Belgium—a circumstance
the man behind the scarecrow perhaps forgot—and they who
have been watching Germany at work in their neighbour’s country
are not going to be alarmed at this silly German “John Bull.” They
know the real John Bull at first hand, and his methods of conducting
commerce and practising war. It was not John Bull who torpedoed the
<i>Tubantia</i> and committed a thousand other pirate and brigand acts
against this neutral power. It was not John Bull who in August of
last year wrote to the Burgomaster of little Wavre and demanded
£120,000, failing which Wavre would be set on fire and destroyed
“without distinction of persons, the innocent to suffer with the guilty.”</p>

<p>Holland is staunch, for she knows that Germany’s care for the weak
nations is the good wife’s love for the chickens and the butcher’s for the
lamb. Michael would like to thrust his revolver into John’s hand and
pretend afterwards that he had pulled the trigger; but the smiling
Dutch frontier guard is in no danger of being deceived.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
